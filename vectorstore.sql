Anfang ist schwer“. Dies gilt auch für das wissenschaftliche Arbeiten, für das\neine Reihe von Voraussetzungen erfüllt sein muss. Vorzustellen sind hierfür drei Tätigkeitsbereiche,\ndie für das wissenschaftliche Arbeiten wesentlich sind: Erstens die Recherche\nund Materialbeschaffung, zweitens die Lektüre und drittens die Darstellung.\nBei der Recherche und Materialbeschaffung begeben Sie sich auf die Suche nach dem\nfür Ihre Arbeit relevanten Material. Wissenschaftlich zu arbeiten heißt nämlich, sich\ngewisser Hilfsmittel zu bedienen. Was sind das für Hilfsmittel? Wo finde ich sie? Wie\nsollte ich mich ihrer bedienen? – Diese Fragen stehen im Mittelpunkt des Abschnittes 1.1\n„Recherche und Materialbeschaffung“.\nBei dem, was Sie in der Recherche zusammengetragen haben, wird es sich überwiegend\num Texte handeln. Der nächste Schritt, der nun folgen muss, ist die Lektüre dieser\nTexte. In der Recherche erfolgte die Auswahl nur per Grobeinschätzung, um überhaupt\nan die Materialien zu gelangen, die eventuell wichtig für Ihre Arbeit sind. Nun heißt es,\ndurch die Lektüre der Materialien tiefer in das Thema einzusteigen. Hierzu stellen wir\nIhnen in Abschnitt 1.2 Formen und Techniken vor, die Ihnen hilfreich sein können.\nLetztendlich läuft dies alles auf eines hinaus: Das Schreiben eines eigenen Textes,\nwobei die gelesenen Quellen nun auch zur Anwendung kommen.

Anfang ist schwer“. Dies gilt auch für das wissenschaftliche Arbeiten, für das\neine Reihe von Voraussetzungen erfüllt sein muss. Vorzustellen sind hierfür drei Tätigkeitsbereiche,\ndie für das wissenschaftliche Arbeiten wesentlich sind: Erstens die Recherche\nund Materialbeschaffung, zweitens die Lektüre und drittens die Darstellung.\nBei der Recherche und Materialbeschaffung begeben Sie sich auf die Suche nach dem\nfür Ihre Arbeit relevanten Material. Wissenschaftlich zu arbeiten heißt nämlich, sich\ngewisser Hilfsmittel zu bedienen. Was sind das für Hilfsmittel? Wo finde ich sie? Wie\nsollte ich mich ihrer bedienen? – Diese Fragen stehen im Mittelpunkt des Abschnittes 1.1\n„Recherche und Materialbeschaffung“.\nBei dem, was Sie in der Recherche zusammengetragen haben, wird es sich überwiegend\num Texte handeln. Der nächste Schritt, der nun folgen muss, ist die Lektüre dieser\nTexte. In der Recherche erfolgte die Auswahl nur per Grobeinschätzung, um überhaupt\nan die Materialien zu gelangen, die eventuell wichtig für Ihre Arbeit sind. Nun heißt es,\ndurch die Lektüre der Materialien tiefer in das Thema einzusteigen. Hierzu stellen wir\nIhnen in Abschnitt 1.2 Formen und Techniken vor, die Ihnen hilfreich sein können.\nLetztendlich läuft dies alles auf eines hinaus: Das Schreiben eines eigenen Textes,\nwobei die gelesenen Quellen nun auch zur Anwendung kommen.

und Lernziele\nLiebe Studierende,\nherzlich willkommen zum Studienbrief Wissenschaftliches Arbeiten . In diesem Studien-\nbrief möchten wir Ihnen die Grundlagen zum wissenschaftlichen Arbeiten vermitteln. Wissenschaftliche Arbeiten im Rahmen des Studiums sind an sich schon anspruchsvoll \ngenug und es ist äußerst ratsam, die Grundlagen zum wissenschaftlichen Arbeiten aus \ndem Effeff zu beherrschen. Wenn Sie das im Folgenden Angebotene verinnerlichen, werden Sie sehen, dass Wissenschaft aufregend ist und viel Spaß und Freude macht, \nnicht zuletzt dann, wenn Sie mit Ihrem Projekt gute Fortschritte machen.\nBevor Sie eine eigene wissenschaftliche Arbeit schreiben können, müssen Sie in den \nwissenschaftlichen Diskurs  einsteigen. Wissenschaft ist nämlich im Wesentlichen \nTeamarbeit. Das bedeutet, dass vorhandenes Wissen aufgegriffen und kritisch weiter \nverwendet wird. Soll dieser Einstieg in den Diskurs gelingen, muss zunächst der Stand \ndes Wissens auf einem Gebiet recherchiert werden.\nDie wichtigsten Orte, an denen man nach wissenschaftlichen Quellen recherchieren \nkann, sowie die wichtigsten Instrumente, mit denen die Suche durchgeführt werden \nkann, werden im Kapitel 1 Wissenschaftliche Vorarbeit des Studienbriefs vorgestellt. \nFerner werden Sie damit vertraut gemacht, was alles bei einer Recherche zu beachten ist und wie diese sinnvoll vonstattengehen kann.\nDer Prozess des wissenschaftlichen Arbeitens läuft auf das Erstellen einer wissenschaft-\nlichen Arbeit hinaus. Wissenschaftliche Arbeiten im Rahmen Ihres Studiums können \nhierbei sein:– ein Assignment;\n– ein Projektbericht oder\n– eine Diplomarbeit beziehungsweise eine Bachelor- oder Masterarbeit.\nDer Abschnitt „Lektüre“, der eng mit der Recherche zusammenhängt, beschreibt Tech-\nniken und Tipps zum effizienten Lesen derjenigen Texte, die für Ihre Arbeit vielleicht \nzu bedeutenden Quellen werden.\nDer letzte Abschnitt des ersten Kapitels widmet sich dem Thema „Darstellung“. Schließ-\nlich geht es nicht um das Lesen der Texte anderer, sondern um Ihre eigene wissen-schaftliche Arbeit. Wie zitiere ich richtig? Wie habe ich Tabellen und Abbildungen zu \ngestalten? Und vor allem: Wie schreibe ich wissenschaftlich? – Das sind die in diesem \nAbschnitt zentralen Fragen.\nDas als „Wissenschaftliche Hauptarbeit“ bezeichnete Kapitel 2  geht auf den Aufbau der \nwissenschaftlichen Arbeit ein.\nIn Kapitel 3 , das diesen Studienbrief abschließt, geht es um die Phase der „Wissen-\nschaftlichen Nacharbeit“. Hier wird insbesondere auf das Lektorat eingegangen. Typi-\nsche Fehlerquellen und Verbesserungspotenzial werden aufgezeigt, sodass Sie Ihrem \nLektorat von Anfang an eine bestimmte Richtung zuweisen können.

1\nåSQL3011\nWissenschaftliche Vorarbeit\n„Aller Anfang ist schwer“. Dies gilt auch  für das wissenschaftliche Arbeiten, für das \neine Reihe von Voraussetzungen erfüllt sein muss. Vorzustellen sind hierfür drei Tätig-\nkeitsbereiche, die für das wissenschaftliche Arbeiten wesentlich sind: Erstens die Re-\ncherche und Materialbeschaffung, zweitens die Lektüre und drittens die Darstellung.\nBei der Recherche und Materialbeschaffung  begeben Sie sich auf die Suche nach dem \nfür Ihre Arbeit relevanten Material. Wissenschaftlich zu arbeiten heißt nämlich, sich gewisser Hilfsmittel zu bedienen. Was sind das für Hilfsmittel? Wo finde ich sie? Wie \nsollte ich mich ihrer bedienen? – Diese Fragen stehen im Mittelpunkt des Abschnittes 1.1 \n„Recherche und Materialbeschaffung“.\nBei dem, was Sie in der Recherche zusammengetragen haben, wird es sich überwiegend \num Texte handeln. Der nächste Schritt, der nun folgen muss, ist die Lektüre  dieser \nTexte. In der Recherche erfolgte die Auswahl nur per Grobeinschätzung, um überhaupt \nan die Materialien zu gelangen, die eventuell wichtig für Ihre Arbeit sind. Nun heißt es, durch die Lektüre der Materialien tiefer in das Thema einzusteigen. Hierzu stellen wir \nIhnen in Abschnitt 1.2 Formen und Techniken vor, die Ihnen hilfreich sein können.\nLetztendlich läuft dies alles auf eines hinaus: Das Schreiben eines eigenen Textes, \nwobei die gelesenen Quellen nun auch zur Anwendung kommen. Wissenschaftlich zu schreiben will gelernt sein. In Abschnitt 1.3, der sich nicht nur aufs Schreiben bezieht, \nsondern generell aufs wissenschaftliche Darstellen , finden Sie Regeln und Tipps, die \nIhnen das Schreiben erleichtern können.\n1.1\nRecherche und Materialbeschaffung\nDie folgenden Abschnitte beschäftigen sich mit der Recherche im Rahmen von wissen-\nschaftlichen Arbeiten. Sie sollen Ihnen einen grundlegenden Einblick in die Arten von \nQuellen geben, die Sie für Ihre eigene Arbeit heranziehen können.\nIm ersten Abschnitt geht es zunächst um die Bedeutung der Recherche. Nach der Lek-\ntüre werden Sie verstehen, warum die Recherche auch in engem Zusammenhang mit der Ausgestaltung des Themas steht.\nIm Anschluss soll anhand einer Klassifikation der Literatur beschrieben werden, welche \nunterschiedlichen Quellenarten es gibt und was von der jeweiligen Gruppe zu erwarten \nist. Dies ist besonders hilfreich, weil bei einer wissenschaftlichen Recherche anfangs noch nicht genau bekannt ist, was sich hinter einem Text beziehungsweise einem Titel \nverbirgt.

1\nåSQL3011.1.1\nBedeutung der Recherche\nDie Recherche bildet die Grundlage einer wissenschaftlichen Arbeit . Sie ist daher von \nextremer Wichtigkeit für Ihr Studium.\nAlle wissenschaftlichen Arbeiten, die Sie im Rahmen ihres Studiums erstellen werden, \nbasieren auf einer gut durchgeführten R echerche. Der Umfang der Recherche steht \nnatürlich in Abhängigkeit zur Art der verfolgten Arbeit. Bachelor-Arbeit, Master-Arbeit \nund Diplomarbeit etwa verlangen in der Regel eine umfangreichere Recherche als eine elektronische Präsentation oder ein Assignment.\nRecherche bedeutet Suche, und zwar die Suche nach bestimmten Materialien. Nach \nwelchen Materialien gesucht wird (und in welchem Umfang), das entscheidet das \nThema  des Projektes. Das Thema zu kennen ist also eine Voraussetzung für den Start in \ndie Recherche. Aber das bedeutet nicht, dass die Recherche das Thema nicht noch etwa \nverändern oder ihm neue Aspekte hinzufügen kann. Denn auch wenn das Thema der \nwissenschaftlichen Arbeit etwa durch die Hochschule oder einen Dozenten vorgegeben wird, so bietet es in der Regel doch Interpretations- und Gestaltungsspielraum. Diesen \nauszufüllen ist auch teilweise Aufgabe der Recherche.\nDie Arbeitsabläufe Themenwahl und -ausgestaltung auf der einen Seite und Recherche \nauf der anderen Seite können sich also durchaus überlappen, wobei eine (erste, vorläu-fige) Formulierung eines Themas der Recherche immer vorausgehen muss, um diese \nnicht willkürlich werden zu lassen.\nRecherche als Prozess Ehe auf das Ziel und den dahinter liegenden Sinn der Recherche näher eingegangen \nwird, sei noch ein Wort zur Recherche als Prozess gesagt. Wie eben erwähnt, über-\nschneidet sich die Recherche mit der vorher angesetzten Themenfindung. Aber auch in \ndie andere Richtung kommt es zu Überschneidungen: Der Prozess des Lesens von Quellen und der des Verfassens der Arbeit werden in der Regel von neuen Recherche-\nschüben  begleitet. Der Grund hierfür ist das sukzessive Erkennen der Zusammenhänge, \ndie immer wieder zu neuen Anforderungen an die Quellen führen können. Denn aus jeder „guten“ Quelle lernt man etwas Neues und erkennt auch, was man noch nicht \n(ausreichend gut) weiß.\nZiel der Recherche Das Ziel der Recherche besteht darin, sich in ein Thema nachweislich einzuarbeiten . \nNachweislich heißt, dass die verwendeten Quellen in der wissenschaftlichen Arbeit aus-drücklich benannt und ggf. diskutiert werden. Damit ist es dem Leser der abgeschlosse-\nnen wissenschaftlichen Arbeit möglich, selbst auf diese Quellen zurückzugreifen und \neventuell gezogene Schlüsse und Thesen nachzuvollziehen. Die Arbeit wird damit prüf-bar und, jedenfalls hinsichtlich der Quellen, transparent. Diese Qualitäten sollte eine \nwissenschaftliche Arbeit unbedingt vorweisen können: Transparenz und Nachvollzieh-\nbarkeit .\nEine weitere Eigenschaft Ihrer Arbeit muss Aktualität  sein. Darauf ist bei der Material-\nsuche bereits zu achten, denn während der Recherche sollen die Weichen so gestellt \nwerden, dass dabei der aktuelle Forschungsstand erarbeitet wird. Die Arbeit mit regel-\nmäßig gepflegten und aktualisierten Datenbanken ist aus diesem Grund unerlässlich. Es reicht also nicht, einfach im Internet zu „googeln“ oder die Internetbibliothek Wikipe-\ndia zu nutzen.

1\nåSQL301Produkt der Recherche Das Produkt der Recherche ist, einfach gesagt, das Literaturverzeichnis  der jeweiligen \nArbeit. Zu Beginn der Recherche, wenn noch unbekannte Titel gesammelt werden, ist das Verzeichnis natürlich noch nicht endgültig. Denn über die endgültige Aufnahme \neiner Quelle in das Literaturverzeichnis kann man erst entscheiden, wenn man die \nQuelle durchgearbeitet und entschieden hat, dass sie zu der eigenen Arbeit passt. Solange das Durcharbeiten nicht erfolgt ist und die recherchierten Quellen quasi noch \n„Terra incognita“ sind, spricht man von einer Ausgangsbibliografie\n1. Sie ist eine Art \ndynamisches Arbeitsverzeichnis, ein Rohentwurf für das spätere Literaturverzeichnis. Vor allem aber ist sie eines: Eine Leseliste, die abzuarbeiten ist, nachdem die Materia-\nlien beschafft worden sind.\nKontinuität und\nTeamarbeitDie Recherche erfüllt im Rahmen des wissenschaftlichen Arbeitens aber noch eine wei-\ntere sehr wichtige Funktion. Denn sie stellt so etwas wie Kontinuität her. Denn wer wis-\nsenschaftlich arbeitet sollte nicht immer ganz am Anfang beginnen und das Rad immer \nneu erfinden. Er sollte sich vielmehr auf das stützen, was bereits vorhanden und bekannt ist. So ist es beispielsweise nicht sinnvoll, sich der Optimierung eines Datenmodells zu \nwidmen, ohne sich vorher zu informieren, wie andere bei einem solchen Problem vor-\ngegangen sind und welcher Methoden sie sich bedient haben.\nGleichzeitig sichert diese Kontinuität, dass sich Wissenschaften weiterentwickeln kön-\nnen und dass der Bestand des Wissens auf einem Gebiet stetig wächst. Denn würde \njeder wieder bei Null beginnen, wäre wissenschaftliches Arbeiten im wahrsten Sinne \neine Sisyphusarbeit.\n2\nDurch die Verwendung von Quellen und das Recherchieren von bereits Bekanntem \nwird aus der Einzelkämpferdisziplin eine Teamarbeit.  Denn jeder wissenschaftlich \nTätige ist in höchstem Maße auf die anderen wissenschaftlich Arbeitenden angewiesen, die sich in demselben Fachgebiet oder auch anderen für seine Forschung relevanten Fachgebieten betätigen.\nUnter Teamarbeit ist allerdings nicht zu verstehen, dass alle Quellen kritiklos übernom-\nmen werden. Vielmehr ist eine ständige kritische Reflexion nötig. Diese bezieht sich \neinerseits auf die Glaubwürdigkeit der Quelle, denn auch geschriebene Texte können irren oder veralten. Und andererseits muss der Recherchierende fortwährend prüfen, ob \ndie Quelle inhaltlich und fachlich zu seiner Arbeit passt. Denn nichts ist lästiger, als \nAusführungen in einer wissenschaftlichen Arbeit zu finden, die zwar nicht zum Thema passen, aber dem Autor irgendwie interessant erschienen.\nDaher ist es wichtig, die Recherche zeitlich nicht zu knapp anzusetzen. Eine gute, d. h. \ngründliche Recherche braucht Zeit und da auf ihr die weitere wissenschaftliche Arbeit \nberuht, ist sie eine essenzielle Arbeitsphase und Aktivität, die gar nicht wichtig genug \ngenommen werden kann.\n3\n1 Vgl. ECO, 2007, S.79 f.\n2 Sisyphus war nach Homer ein König von Korinth, der zur Strafe für seine Gier einen Stein mit bloßen \nHänden einen hohen Berg hinaufwälzen sollte. Dieser rollt jedoch immer wieder hinunter, sodass Sisy-\nphus immer wieder von vorne anfangen musste.\n3T HEISEN  (2006) etwa versteht die Materialauswertung und das Verfassen der Arbeit als interaktiven \nProzess und setzt hierfür 75 % der gesamten geplanten Zeit für die Arbeit an.

1\nåSQL301K[1] Warum ist es wichtig, in einer wissenschaftlichen Arbeit die Quellen nachzuweisen?\nK[9] Was bedeutet Recherchieren?\nK[36] Bei der Materialsuche für eine wissenschaftliche Arbeit soll der aktuelle Forschungs-\nstand erarbeitet werden. Deshalb sollten die verwendeten Quellen nicht älter sein wie \n(kreuzen Sie die richtige Antwort an):\na) drei Jahre ü\nb) ca. fünf Jahre ü\nc) ca. zehn Jahre ü\nd) ca. 15 Jahre ü\n1.1.2\nSuchstrategie und Klassifikation der recherchierten Literatur\nPro Jahr werden in Deutschland etwa 90 000 Bücher in Form von Erst- oder Neuauf-\nlagen auf den Markt gebracht. Daneben erscheinen immer mehr E-Books und Hörbü-cher. Natürlich geht ein Großteil dieser Publikationen auf das Konto der Belletristik. \nAuch Übersetzungen und Lizenzausgaben spielen eine große Rolle. Trotzdem wird da-\nmit auch der wachsende Umfang an Publikationen zu verschiedensten Forschungsgebie-ten deutlich (https://www.boersenverein.de/de/portal/Buchhandel/158352, Zugriff am \n19.6.2017). Experten schätzen mittlerweile, dass sich das Wissen weltweit alle acht bis \nzwölf Jahre verdoppelt, mit kürzer werdenden Halbwertszeiten. Allein zum Stichwort „wissenschaftlich arbeiten“ lassen sich per Google innerhalb von 0,45 Sekunden über 51 600 Suchergebnisse finden (https://www.google.de/search?q=%22wissenschaft-\nlich+arbeiten%22&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8&client=firefox-b&gfe_rd=cr&ei=rKhHWa2-\nJPIOT8Qec7Y3YCg, Zugriff am 17.6.2017). Bei der Suche nach Quellen muss also strukturiert vorgegangen werden. Dazu ist eine Suchstrategie hilfreich und der Gebrauch \nvon Klassifikationen sinnvoll.\n1.1.2.1\nMögliche Suchstrategien\nSuchstrategien helfen dabei, das Suchfeld einzugrenzen. Dazu muss man wissen, \nwonach man eigentlich sucht. Grundsätzlich gibt es zwei Möglichkeiten:Für das wissenschaftliche Arbeiten sind drei Punkte wesentlich: die Recherche samt \nMaterialbeschaffung, die Lektüre und die Darstellung.\nDie Recherche bildet die Grundlage einer wissenschaftlichen Arbeit. Recherchieren \nheißt, sich gezielt kundig machen über ein bestimmtes Fachgebiet und dessen aktu-\nellen Forschungsstand. Das Produkt der Recherche ist letztlich das Literaturver-\nzeichnis.

1\nåSQL301– heuristische Suchstrategien und\n– eine systematische Recherche.\nUm die Nadel im Heuhaufen, also die für das eigene Thema relevanten Publikationen, \nzu finden, lassen sich sogenannte heuristische Suchstrategien einsetzen. Dabei beginnt \nman ganz pragmatisch, indem man sich von allgemeinen Suchbegriffen zu spezielleren vorarbeitet. Ein erster Einstieg sind also bekannte Lehrbücher aus dem Bereich des zu bearbeitenden Themas oder Überblicksar tikel. Auch die Lerneinheiten der AKAD zu \nden einzelnen Modulen bieten mit ihren Inhalten und Quellenangaben einen guten ers-\nten Einstieg in eine Thematik. Ideal ist es, bei dieser Recherche einen sogenannten „State of the Art“-Artikel zu finden, der die neuesten Sichtweisen und Entwicklungen \nim relevanten Forschungsbereich beschreibt. Solche Artikel sind häufig in Hand-\nbüchern, Handwörterbüchern und fachspezifischen Lexika zu finden. Wie bei einem Schneeballsystem ist es dann möglich, auf der Basis dieser ersten Rechercheergebnisse \nkonkretere Suchbegriffe zu identifizieren und weitere Publikationen zu entdecken.\nDer große Vorteil dieser Vorgehensweise ist, dass man viel Literatur in kurzer Zeit fin-\ndet. Allerdings muss diese Masse natürlich auch gelesen und bewertet werden. Ein zweites Problem ist, dass bei dieser Vorgehensweise eher ältere Publikationen gefunden \nwerden. Auch die Gefahr einer etwas einseitigen Sichtweise kann dabei auftreten, denn \nAutoren, die sich wechselseitig zitieren, dürften eine eher homogene Meinung haben.\nBei einer systematischen Recherche nimmt man einen präzisen und eher engen Suchbe-\ngriff als Ausgangspunkt der Recherche her. Genauso gut lässt sich die Trefferquote ein-\nschränken mit der semantischen Methode. Hierbei werden zwei oder drei Suchbegriffe \ngemeinsam als Ausgangsbasis verwendet. Über Kataloge von Bibliotheken oder Daten-banken wie EBSCO oder Scholar werden dann Publikationen zu den betreffenden Such-\nbegriffen ermittelt. Solche Datenbanken sind teilweise jedoch kostenpflichtig oder auf \nbestimmte Themenbereiche beschränkt.\nNeben der Verwendung einer Suchstrategie ist der Gebrauch von Klassifikationen sinn-\nvoll, um sich in der Fülle an wissenschaftlicher Literatur zu orientieren. Diese Fülle an \neinsetzbarem Schrifttum kann nach verschiedenen Kriterien systematisiert werden, wie \nz. B. nach dem wissenschaftlichen Anspruch oder anhand der Sachnähe.\nAbbildung 1:\nAusgewählte Kriterien\nzur Systematisierung von\nFachliteratur\nFür die Zwecke der Recherche ist die Einteilung der grundlegenden Formen wichtig.

1\nåSQL301–Monografien:  sie werden auch als selbstständige Schriften bezeichnet. Es sind the-\nmatisch in sich geschlossene Texte von einem oder mehreren Autoren.\n–Unselbstständige Schriften:  sind keine alleinstehenden Werke, sondern erscheinen in \neinem bestimmten Kontext.\n–Graue Literatur:  ist eine Sammelbezeichnung für nicht verlagsgebundene Publika-\ntionen, die nicht über den Handel vertrieben werden. \nDiese drei Gruppen von Publikationen betrachten wir uns nun detaillierter.\n1.1.2.2\nSelbstständige Schriften (Monografien)\nMonografien werden auch unter der Sammelbezeichnung selbstständige Schriften  \nzusammengefasst. Diese einschlägigen Texte sind durch ihre konzentrierte Form und \neindeutige inhaltliche Ausrichtung auf ein Thema ein unschätzbarer Fundus, der sowohl \nzu Beginn einer wissenschaftlichen Arbeit als auch innerhalb deren Verlauf gute \nDienste leistet, hier als Einstieg, da als fortgesetztes Studium und Vertiefung.\nMonografien sind in sich geschlossene Texte, von einem oder mehreren Autoren stam-\nmend, die sich mit einem abgegrenzten Themenfeld befassen (vgl. Niederhauser 2006, \nS. 14). Der Konzentration auf ein einzelnes Themengebiet ist der Begriff Monografie \ngeschuldet. Monografien können einzeln erscheinen, aber auch in einer Serie oder \nReihe.\nDie Autoren von Monografien belegen ihre Ausführungen wiederum mit Quellen-\nangaben. Damit eigenen sich Monografien als Einstieg in eine Recherche, denn mit den \nHinweisen auf weitere Quellen kann das Wissensgebiet weiter durchdrungen werden. Monografien zählen deshalb zu den am häufigsten zitierten Werken.\nPublikationsformen selbstständiger Schriften\nBei folgenden Publikationsformen handelt es sich um Monografien:\n– Fachbücher,– Handbücher,\n– Lexika und\n– Lehrbücher.\nFachbücher Fachbücher  zeichnen sich durch den hohen Anspruch aus, nichts Geringeres als das \nSpezialwissen von Fachleuten zu beinhalten. In Fachbüchern sind Fachkenntnisse in ge-bündelter Form vorzufinden und meist in einer bestimmten Fachsprache dargestellt.\nHandbücher Handbücher  sind in der Regel einbändig und von einem Verfasser geschrieben. Sobald \nmehrere Bände vorliegen, spricht man von einem Nachschlagewerk. Sie gehören auch der Gruppe der Monografien an, wird in ihnen doch auch ein bestimmter Gegenstand \nzum Dreh- und Angelpunkt sämtlicher Ausführungen. Eine besondere Qualität der \nHandbücher besteht darin, dass hier ein Wissensgebiet in geordneter, zum zielstrebigen Nachschlagen geeigneter Form dargeboten wird (vgl. Niederhauser 2006, S. 14).

1\nåSQL301hand der Überschrift bzw. der einleitenden Worte des ersten Abschnitts werden Fragen \nformuliert.\n3. Read (Lesen):  Nun folgt eine intensive Lektüre des Abschnitts. Dabei wird die anhand \nder Überschrift formulierte Fragengruppe im Auge behalten und aufgrund der nun gele-senen Inhalte so weit wie möglich beantwortet.\n4. Reflect (Reflektieren):  In diesem Schritt vergleicht der Leser das Gelesene mit seinem \neigenen Wissens- und Erfahrungsschatz. Zentrale Frage ist, ob die Aussagen des Textes \nplausibel sind und mit den Erfahrungen des Lesers übereinstimmen. Denn auch ge-\ndruckten Texten sollte man nie blind vertrauen.\n5. Recite (Rezitieren):  Die wichtigsten Inhalte des Abschnitts werden wiederholt. Fragen \nund Antworten werden zusammengefasst und in gebündelter Form vergegenwärtigt. In diesem Schritt ist auch die Gelegenheit gegeben, an den Stellen nachzulesen, die noch \nunklar geblieben sind oder auch, wenn etwas nicht vollständig wiedergegeben werden \nkann. Dieser Schritt ist bereits die Vorbereitung darauf, die Erkenntnisse des Textes für den eigenen Text aufzubereiten. Denn nur wenn eine Originalquelle tief verstanden \nwurde, kann Sie einen Beitrag zu Ihrem wissenschaftlichen Text leisten.\n6. Review (Rückschau):  Am Ende wird alles Gelesene zusammengetragen: alle Inhalte der \neinzelnen Abschnitte mitsamt aller zentralen Fragen und Antworten.\nDer vierte Punkt „Reflect“ ist besonders hervorzuheben. Er spricht die kritische Refle-\nxion an. Sie ist beim wissenschaftlichen Arbeiten unbedingt erforderlich. Kritik ist eine \nder Haupteigenschaften wissenschaftlichen Arbeitens oder sollte es zumindest sein.\nDas Begriffsverständnis von Kritik im wisse nschaftlichen Zusammenhang ist nicht das-\nselbe, wie in der Alltagssprache, denn in der Wissenschaft ist die Kritik in den aller-\nmeisten Fällen eine bedeutende Quelle für neue Erkenntnisse – und nicht nur das Genörgel eines Nachbarn. Wenn also eine kritische Reflexion eines Textes gefordert ist, \nheißt das, dass die einzelnen Aspekte zu hinterfragen sind und wenn möglich etwas zur \nVerbesserung beigetragen wird. Damit ist Kritik in der Wissenschaft ausdrücklich er-wünscht. Das betrifft sowohl die Kritik an sich selbst und seinem Vorgehen sowie die \nKritik an anderen und ihrem Vorgehen. Das Entscheidende dabei ist, dass die Kritik \nsachlich und begründet ist.\nBeim Lesen wissenschaftlicher Literatur werden unterschiedliche Lesetechniken \nangewendet. Literatur, die für die eigene Forschung relevant ist, wird vor allem kur-\nsorisch und intensiv gelesen. Dabei kann es hilfreich sein, die PQ4R-Methode anzu-wenden, durch die ein Text systematisch erarbeitet wird.

1\nåSQL301K[3] Was passiert in dem Schritt „Reflect“ der PQ4R-Methode?\nK[39] Welche Fragen helfen dabei, einen Beitrag oder einen Quelle als hilfreich für die eigene \nwissenschaftliche Arbeit einzustufen? Kreuzen Sie die richtigen Antworten an.\na) Enthält das Inhaltsverzeichnis Bestandteile, die sich mit „meinem“ Thema \ndecken? ü\nb) Sind Schlüsselbegriffe der eigenen Arbeit im Stichwortverzeichnis zu finden? ü\nc) Sind die Ziele, die in der Einleitung des Beitrags formuliert worden sind, \nzumindest teilweise deckungsgleich mit denjenigen „meiner“ Arbeit? ü\nd) Wurden die akademischen Titel der Autoren vollständig aufgeführt? ü\n1.2.3\nQuellen und Erkenntnisse dokumentieren\nDer Mensch ist vergesslich und je mehr Input er bekommt, desto wichtiger wird es, das \nWissen zu organisieren. Nachfolgend sollen Ihnen daher einige mögliche Hilfsmittel \nzur Organisation von neu erworbenem Wissen genannt werden. Schließlich wollen Sie \nnicht, dass die Lektüre der mühsam recherchierten Literatur ins Leere läuft.\nBei den Vorbereitungen zu einer wissenschaftlichen Arbeit, besonders einer Abschluss-\narbeit, kommen Sie mit einer Menge Material in Berührung. Sie lesen viele Bücher und müssen das Gelesene irgendwie behalten. Auf irgendeine der vielen Informationen wer-\nden Sie nämlich früher oder später zurückgreifen wollen, z. B. genau dann, wenn Sie \ngerade mit dem Verfassen eines Kapitels beschäftigt sind, das sich mit derselben The-matik beschäftigt. Das kann einige Wochen oder Monate später erfolgen, nachdem Sie \ndie passende Stelle in einem Buch gelesen haben. Man muss also dafür sorgen, das \nGelesene irgendwie zu konservieren, damit man es auch zu einem späteren Zeitpunkt zur Hand hat. Denn der Gebrauch von Quellen muss in einer wissenschaftlichen Arbeit nachgewiesen werden.\nKarteikästen , in denen mit z. B. Stichworten beschriebene Karteikarten aufbewahrt wer-\nden, mögen heutzutage etwas altmodisch anmuten, zumal der Gebrauch von Papier \nimmer mehr durch den Gebrauch digitaler Medien ersetzt wird bzw. ersetzt werden soll. Letztendlich aber sollte der individuelle Lernstil entscheiden, ganz gleich, ob etwas alt-\nmodisch wirkt oder nicht. Was in der Wissenschaft zählt, ist das gelungene Sortieren \nund Überschauen von einem immer größer werdenden Wissensschatz.\nDennoch sind die Vorteile einer elektronischen Tabellen  und Datenbank  auf dem eige-\nnen PC nicht zu unterschätzen. Mithilfe von Software für Textverarbeitung, Tabellen-\nkalkulation und Literaturverwaltung, um nur einige zu nennen, können Ordnungen un-\nterschiedlichen Grades hergestellt werden. Durch die beständige Möglichkeit der Datenänderung, das problemlose Hinzufügen von Daten und das umgekehrte Heraus-\nlöschen, ist ein quasi reibungsloses Arbeiten in dynamischen Dokumenten möglich.

1\nåSQL301V Zu den Vorteilen  der Computernutzung zählen also:\nPdie Möglichkeit zu effizientem und schnellem Navigieren durch Such- und Sortier-\nfunktionen. So können in Tabellen unterschiedliche Datenfelder als Sortierparameter \nverwendet werden. Es kann in ein und demselben Dokument nach Schlagworten und \nnach Verfassern gesucht werden.\nPdie Möglichkeit, Informationen aus dem Internet und anderen Dateien zu kopieren, \nindividuell zu markieren oder ggf. auch direkt in die eigenen Dokumente einzufügen \n(z. B. Zitate, die ohnehin im Wortlaut wiedergegeben werden).\nPdie Möglichkeit, Hypertext-Verknüpfungen anzulegen.\nBücher, die sich in eigenem Besitz befinden, bringen den Vorteil mit sich, dass man \njederzeit auf sie zurückgreifen kann. Es ist möglich, Anstreichungen zu machen, Kom-\nmentare an den Rand zu schreiben, Textstellen farblich zu kennzeichnen und Seiten \ndurch selbstklebende Fähnchen zu markieren. Dies sind nur ein paar Beispiele, mit denen ein Text so bearbeitet werden kann, dass der Leser auch noch Wochen oder \nMonat später die Seite mit der relevanten Textstelle wiederfinden kann.\nEntliehene Bücher müssen wieder zurückgeben werden und das meist früher, als man \nmöchte. In sie darf man nicht hineinschreiben und muss von Anfang an davon aus-gehen, sie bald nicht mehr zur Hand nehmen zu können. Damit die Lektüre wichtiger \nTexte dennoch zu Ergebnissen führt, auf die später zurückgegriffen werden kann, bieten \nsich Fotokopien an. Nicht umsonst spricht man bei der Literaturrecherche zu wissen-schaftlichen Quellen augenzwinkernd auch vom „studentischen Dreikampf“: Kopieren, \nLochen und Abheften.\n1\nObgleich es sicherlich nie ganz ohne Kopien gehen wird, sollten Sie die Zeit in Biblio-theken immer so einteilen, dass Sie die Quellen vor dem Kopieren in jedem Fall einmal \npunktuell gelesen haben und recht gut einschätzen können, dass Sie den Text tatsächlich brauchen. Jedes andere Vorgehen ist aus ökonomischen und ökologischen Gründen \nsinnlos.\n2\nK[6] Worauf ist schon frühzeitig beim Lesen zu achten?\nK[14] Erläutern Sie, warum es hilfreich sein kann, für die Archivierung von Quellen und \nInhalten einen Computer zu verwenden.\n1T HEISEN  (2006) warnt allerdings vor dem Versuch, „alle [Hervorhebung im Original] benötigte Lite-\nratur [Hervorhebung im Original] zu kopieren [Hervorhebung im Original] und nach Hause zu schlep-\npen“.

1\nåSQL3011.3\nZitierweise und Quellenangaben\nWissenschaftliche Arbeiten unterscheiden sich, wie schon angemerkt, von anderen Tex-\nten, auch von der Darstellung her. Den meisten Menschen fallen erst einmal die vielen Fußnoten und wörtlichen Zitate auf, die ein wissenschaftliches Dokument auszeichnen. \nAls Zweites fallen Ihnen dann in der Regel die formalen Verzeichnisse auf. Tatsächlich \nhandelt es sich bei diesen Merkmalen um besondere Charakteristika von wissenschaft-lichen Arbeiten. Diese formale Gestaltung ist jedoch notwendig, um dem Anspruch der \nNachvollziehbarkeit gerecht zu werden. \nZum Zweiten ist der Anspruch der Einheitlichkeit zu berücksichtigen. Bei der Gestal-\ntung von wissenschaftlichen Arbeiten gibt es zwar – innerhalb der Vorgaben der Hoch-schule – Gestaltungsspielräume, doch hat die Darstellung einheitlich zu sein. Haben Sie \nsich also beispielsweise für eine bestimmte Zitierweise entschieden, dann muss das aus-\ngewählte System konsequent angewendet werden. Eine uneinheitliche Form wirkt schlampig und vermindert die Glaubwürdigkeit des Autors. Zudem wird ein Gutachter \nbei der Bewertung einer wissenschaftlichen Arbeit nicht nur die Inhalte berücksichti-\ngen, sondern auch die Einhaltung der formalen Vorgaben. Deshalb schauen wir uns im Folgenden die Vorgaben der AKAD University detaillierter an. Sie orientieren sich \nweitgehend an der internationalen Norm DIN ISO 690.\n1.3.1\nTechniken der Zitierweise\nForschung ist Teamwork. Das wissen Sie bereits. Ein junger Forscher muss also nicht \ndas Rad neu erfinden. Er kann durchaus Ideen und Gedanken von anderen Experten übernehmen. Eine derartige Übernahme fremder Gedanken muss jedoch auch in der \neigenen wissenschaftlichen Arbeit gezeigt werden – und das geschieht durch Quellen-\nangaben. Die Angabe der verwendeten Quellen wird systematisch gestaltet und das ist dann die Zitierweise. Bei allen Ausführungen, die ohne Quellenangaben in einem \nAssignment, einer Bachelor- oder Masterarbeit zu finden sind, handelt es sich um \neigene Ideen des Autors. Wenn also fremde Gedanken übernommen werden, ohne eine Quelle anzugeben, dann ist das ein Plagiat bzw. ein Diebstahl geistigen Eigentums.\n1.3.1.1\nWörtliche Zitate und Plagiate\nNun gibt es jedoch verschiedene Formen an Zitaten und deren Gestaltung in einer wis-\nsenschaftlichen Arbeit. Die wichtigsten Formen sind das direkte und das indirekte Zitat.\nDas direkte Zitat  wird auch als wörtliches Zitat bezeichnet. Hier werden die fremden \nIdeen tatsächlich wortwörtlich aus einem Lexikon oder aus einer Monografie oder einer sonstigen Quelle abgeschrieben. Auf den genauen Wortlaut kommt es in der Regel bei \nder Definition von Fachbegriffen an oder bei prägnanten Aussagen. Längere wörtliche \nZitate, d. h. über mehr als fünf Zeilen hinweg, sollten jedoch vermieden werden. Jedes wörtliche Zitat wird durch Anführungszeichen („…“) gekennzeichnet.

1\nåSQL301verändert werden. Selbst veraltete Formulierungen müssen übernommen werden, \nebenso wie Schreibfehler. Und wenn einmal ein wörtliches Zitat in einem anderen wört-\nlichen Zitat vorkommen sollte, dann wird das durch einfache Anführungszeichen (,…‘) \ngekennzeichnet. Auf die Details gehen wir in den folgenden Abschnitten noch detail-lierter ein. \nEin indirektes Zitat  liegt vor, wenn fremde Gedanken in eigenen Worten wiedergegeben \noder zusammengefasst werden. Diese Form ist die häufigste. Bei solchen Zitaten entfal-\nlen die Anführungszeichen im Text der Arbeit. Dafür wird der Quellenangabe ein „vgl.“ \nvorangestellt.\nSowohl für direkte wie auch für indirekte Zitate müssen die Quellen angegeben werden. \nIn einer wissenschaftlichen Arbeit soll und darf man, wie schon gesagt, Ideen von ande-\nren übernehmen, muss diese Quellen aber benennen. Dabei sollten die folgenden Fehler \nvermieden werden, denn sonst entsteht ein sogenanntes Plagiat, also ein unrechtmäßiges Nachahmen eines wissenschaftlichen Werks, das ein anderer geschaffen hat (o. V., Pla-\ngiat, Internetquelle). Bei den Plagiaten werden folgende Formen unterschieden (Vgl. \nKarmansin/Ribing, 2008, S. 84):\nPTextplagiate  (Copy & Paste): Texte werden wörtlich übernommen. Dabei werden \njedoch die Quellenangaben „vergessen“.\nPShake & Paste:  verschiedene Teile aus mehreren Werken, meist ganze Absätze, \nwerden extrahiert und dann zusammengeführt, um das Ganze als eigenes Werk aus-\nzugeben.\nPHalbsatzflickerei:  Sätze oder Halbsätze werden umgestellt. Häufig werden Wörter \ndurch Synonyme ersetzt oder die Reihenfolge bei Aufzählungen verändert. \nPBauernopfer:  größere Absätze aus einem oder mehreren Werken werden übernom-\nmen, doch werden nur kurze oder unbedeutende Passagen mit Quellenangaben ver-\nsehen.\nPÜbersetzungsplagiate:  Fremdsprachige Textpassagen werden in die deutsche Spra-\nche übersetzt, jedoch wird auf die Quellenangabe verzichtet.\nPSprachplagiate:  Verwendung von Metaphern, Idiomen oder eleganten sprachlichen \nWendungen, ohne diese auf ihren Verfasser zurückzuführen.\nPZitatsplagiate:  Zitate aus Sekundärliteratur werden übernommen, wobei zwar die \nOriginalquelle angegeben wird, nicht aber die richtige Fundstelle des Zitats.\nBeim Einsatz von wörtlichen Zitaten muss auf „Kleinigkeiten“ geachtet werden, denn \nniemand mag es, wenn seine Aussage verfremdet oder verändert wird.\n1.3.1.2\nAuslassungen, Tippfehler und Übersetzungen von wörtlichen Zitaten\nBei direkten Zitaten handelt es sich, das wissen Sie jetzt, um die wortwörtliche Über-\nnahme von fremden Gedanken und Ideen. Was aber ist, wenn das aufwendig recher-\nchierte und für die eigene Arbeit ideale wörtliche Zitat einfach zu lang ist oder erweitert werden sollte?

1\nåSQL301Handbuch variieren (z. B. chronologische Ordnung, thematische Ordnung, alphabeti-\nsche Ordnung). Welche Ordnungsform von den Herausgebern gewählt wurde, lässt sich \nschnell erkennen.\nB Einige Titelbeispiele für Handbücher lauten (hier nur die Titel ohne weitere bibliografi-\nsche Angaben):\nHandbuch Sportrecht\nEvaluation: Ein systematisches HandbuchWahlkampf im Internet: Handbuch für die politische Online-Kampagn\nHandbuch der Fülltechnik: Grundlagen und Praxis für das Abfüllen flüssiger Produkte\nLexika Lexika  sind nach dem Alphabet geordnete Nachschlagewerke, deren Bandzahl von eins \naufwärts keine Grenzen kennt. Lexika allerd ings, die unter die Publikationsform „Mo-\nnografie“ fallen, sind in der Regel von einem Verfasser, in sich geschlossen und ein-\nbändig.\nLehrbücher Lehrbücher sind spezielle Sachbücher, die für den Unterrichtsgebrauch konzipiert wer-\nden und damit pädagogische und didaktische Momente aufweisen. Darunter etwa fällt \ndie Einteilung in Lektionen (statt in Kapitel oder Abschnitte), der sukzessive Aufbau \nder Stoffvermittlung, der jeweils unterschiedlichen Altersgruppen angepasste Ton und das Vorhandensein von Aufgaben, in denen der durchgenommene Stoff der Lektion \ngeprüft wird.\n1.1.2.3\nUnselbstständige Schriften\nNeben den selbstständigen Schriften existiert die Gruppe der sogenannten unselbststän-\ndigen Schriften . Dazu zählen\n– wissenschaftliche Aufsätze (sogenannte Miszellen) sowie– Beiträge und Artikel, die einen Teil eines größeren Ganzen bilden.\nBeitrag Der Beitrag  erscheint zusammen mit anderen Beiträgen anderer Autoren in einem Sam-\nmelwerk .\nwissenschaftlicher\nAufsatzDer wissenschaftliche Aufsatz  hingegen findet sich z. B. in einer Fachzeitschrift .\nArtikel  finden sich in Zeitungen und Zeitschriften , sind immer publizistischer, aber nicht \nzwingend wissenschaftlicher Natur.\nAllen unselbstständigen Schriften ist gemein, dass sie kein alleinstehendes Werk bilden, \nsondern in einem Kontext erscheinen.\nUnselbstständige Schriften sind insbesondere dann von Interesse, wenn man sich für \neinen speziellen Teilaspekt eines Wissensgebietes interessiert. Denn meist findet man \nzu fast jedem Thema einen passenden Artikel oder Beitrag, der sich mit dem Thema \nauseinandersetzt.

1\nåSQL301Publikationsformen unselbstständiger Schriften\nDie zwei maßgeblichen Publikationsformen für Aufsatz, Beitrag und Artikel sind\n– Herausgeberbände (auch „Sammelwerke“ genannt) und\n– Periodika.\nHerausgeberband Ein Herausgeberband  ist ein verlegtes Fachbuch, das einen oder mehrere Herausgeber \nhat, bei denen es sich um Personen oder Institutionen handeln kann. Die Beiträge der \nunterschiedlichen Autoren beziehen sich auf ein bestimmtes Fachgebiet und sind in der \nRegel allesamt Expertisen , in denen Expertenwissen in höchst verdichteter und knapper \nForm publiziert wird.\nPeriodika Im Gegensatz zu Monografien erscheinen Periodika  in regelmäßigen Abständen. Auf-\ngrund dieser Regelmäßigkeit erheben diese Publikationen den Anspruch der Aktualität . \nBeispiele für Periodika sind Zeitungen, Zeitschriften, darunter auch Monatshefte, Vier-teljahresschriften und Jahresbücher – allesamt Publikationen, die mit einer gewissen \nPeriodizität wieder erscheinen.\n1.1.2.4\nGraue Literatur\nAls Graue Literatur  bezeichnet man Publikationen, die nicht über den normalen Handel \nvertrieben werden, sondern direkt über die Herausgeber bzw. Autoren  zugänglich ge-\nmacht werden (müssen). Im eigentlichen Sinn gehört sie weder zur selbstständigen noch \nzur unselbstständigen Literatur und ist nur fallabhängig einzuordnen.\nDiese jenseits des Buch- und Zeitschriftenmarkts publizierten Schriften können wissen-\nschaftlich relevant, ja notwendig sein, weswegen sie keineswegs außer Acht gelassen werden sollten.\nDie Suche nach Grauer Literatur  verläuft anders als die Suche nach den kommerziell \nveröffentlichten, in den großen Verzeichnissen recherchierbaren Titeln, da sie meist \n(noch) nicht in Quellenverzeichnisse und Datenbanken aufgenommen wurde. Nicht sel-\nten ist das Auffinden solcher Quellen daher mit etwas Glück verbunden und bedarf in jedem Fall erheblicher Erfahrung des Suchenden.\nWichtig ist es, dass auch bei Grauer Literatur die Autoren bzw. Herausgeber angegeben \nund im Literaturverzeichnis verzeichnet werden. Denn auch „Graue Literatur“ muss so \nweit wie möglich nachgewiesen und belegt werden, sofern sie für die wissenschaftliche Arbeit verwendet werden soll.\nIm Literatur- und Quellenverzeichnis ist Graue Literatur gegebenenfalls gesondert zu \nkennzeichnen. Wenn es sich beispielsweise um Bücher oder Artikel aus Fachzeitschrif-\nten handelt, die noch nicht veröffentlicht sind, ist auf diesen Umstand hinzuweisen.

1\nåSQL301Publikationsformen Grauer Literatur\nInsbesondere Hochschulschriften  (darunter auch noch nicht veröffentlichte Dissertationen, \nHabilitationen, Diplom- und Masterarbeiten), Institutsschriften , Webpräsenzen , aber auch \nBerichte , Programmhefte  und Flugblätter , um nur einige zu nennen, zählen zu der soge-\nnannten Grauen Literatur.\nK[21] Was versteht man unter unselbstständigen Schriften?\nK[17] Was ist Graue Literatur?\nK[10] Vervollständigen Sie folgenden Satz:\n„Monografien sind in sich _____________ Texte, die von einem oder mehreren \n_____________ stammen und sich mit einem _____________ Themenfeld befassen.“\nK[37] Eignen sich Lerneinheiten der AKAD University zu einzelnen Modulen als Einstieg in die Recherche zu wissenschaftlichen Ar beiten? Begründen Sie Ihre Antwort.Angesichts der wachsenden Zahl von Publikationen in den meisten Fachgebieten ist \nes hilfreich, bei der Recherche eine Suchstrategie einzusetzen und Klassifikationen \nzu berücksichtigen. Bei den Suchstrategien werden heuristische und eine systema-\ntische Recherche unterschieden. Bei den heuristischen Suchstrategien beginnt man mit allgemeineren Suchbegriffen, um sich zu spezielleren vorzuarbeiten. Wie bei \neinem Schneeballsystem werden aus den Ergebnissen der ersten Recherchen weitere \nQuellen und Stichworte abgeleitet. Bei einer systematischen Recherche nimmt man einen präzisen und eher engen Suchbegriff als Ausgangspunkt der Recherche her. \nDadurch kann die Recherche gezielt gestaltet werden.\nDaneben ist die Orientierung an der Klassifikation der Literatur hilfreich. Dafür gibt \nes verschiedene Kriterien, wie z. B. der wissenschaftliche Anspruch. Für die Zwecke der Recherche ist eine Einteilung in selbstständige und unselbstständige Schriften \nsowie in sogenannte Graue Literatur hilfreich.\nMonografien sind in sich geschlossene Text e, von einem oder mehreren Autoren, die \nsich mit einem abgegrenzten Themenfeld befassen, wie z. B. Fachbücher, Handbücher oder Lexika. Sie sind für die Recherche ein unschätzbarer Fundus, da sie Informatio-\nnen in konzentrierter Form präsentieren. Zudem verfügen sie in der Regel über detail-\nlierte Literaturverzeichnisse und ermöglichen damit eine vertiefte Recherche.\nUnselbstständige Schriften erscheinen zusammen mit den Beiträgen anderer Auto-\nren.

1\nåSQL3011.1.3\nBibliografien\nNun wissen Sie, was Sie von selbstständigen und von unselbstständigen Schriften \nerwarten dürfen. Wie aber finden Sie die Titel, die für Ihre Arbeit themenrelevant sind? Und woher wissen Sie, ob es sich z. B. um eine Monografie handelt, nach der Sie zu \nBeginn der Recherche Ausschau halten? In diesem Abschnitt werden Sie die verschie-\ndenen Erscheinungsformen von Bibliografien kennenlernen; den Zeitschriftenbibliogra-fien widmen wir einen eigenen Abschnitt 1.1.4, da diesen in der wissenschaftlichen \nArbeit und Recherche eine besondere Rolle zukommt.\nDie oben in den Abschnitten 1.1.2.2 und 1.1.2.3 dargestellten Schriften werden in Bib-\nliografien  zusammengestellt, die damit als große Sammelstellen für Literatur bezeich-\nnet werden können. Im Prinzip sind die Literaturverzeichnisse , die Sie am Ende von \nwissenschaftlichen Büchern finden, auch Bibliografien, da sie Literaturangaben zu-\nsammenstellen. Sie eignen sich hervorragend, um in ein Thema tiefer einzusteigen: Zahlreiche Verweise auf weiterführende Li teratur in gebündelter Form – ein wertvol-\nles Mittel für eine Recherche.\nAus den Bibliotheken kennen Sie auch Bibliografien in Form von Katalogen . Heutzu-\ntage werden Kataloge, fast immer in digitaler Form, als Datenbank, angeboten und ver-wendet. Das erleichtert die Suche, da eine Vielzahl unterschiedlicher Suchkriterien ein-\ngegeben werden kann, wobei sehr präzise Resultate erzielt werden.\nPublikationsformen von Bibliografien\nEs gibt unterschiedliche Arten von Bibliografien. Neben den Allgemeinbibliografien , \nauf die wir gleich zu sprechen kommen, gibt es Fachbibliografien  und Spezialbiblio-\ngrafien . Bei Fachbibliografien handelt es sich um Verzeichnisse zu bestimmten Diszip-\nlinen. Spezialbibliografien verzeichnen Literatur von Hochschulen, also sogenannte Hochschulschriften und andere Graue Literatur. Als Sonderfall sei noch die Metabiblio-\ngrafie  erwähnt. Sie ist die Bibliografie der Bibliografien, verzeichnet also die unter-\nschiedlichen Bibliografien und erstellt über diese einen Überblick. In Deutschland wird sie von der Deutschen Bücherei in Leipzig herausgegeben.\nAllgemeinbibliografien Diese verzeichnen, wie der Name es schon sagt, alle Sachgebiete. Dabei betrachten wir \nzunächst Bibliografien, die insbesondere für Buchbestände genutzt werden können. \nDiese Bibliografien können im Rahmen des Erstellens eigener wissenschaftlicher Arbeiten insbesondere zu Anfang genutzt werden, um Quellen mit einem bestimmten \nTitelstichwort oder Werke eines bestimmten Autors zu finden. Letzteres ist insbeson-\ndere dann interessant, wenn man einen Fachmann für das eigene Themenfeld identifi-ziert hat.\nDie \nDeutsche Nationalbibliografie (DNB)  wird von der Deutschen Nationalbibliothek (DNB) \nherausgegeben.

1\nåSQL301K[2] Was ist eine Bibliografie? Wofür können Bibliografien im Rahmen des wissenschaft-\nlichen Arbeitens hilfreich sein?\n1.1.4\nZeitschriftenbibliografien\nWissenschaftliche Forschung hat in den letzten Jahrzehnten deutlich an Dynamik \ngewonnen, sodass viele neue Erkenntnisse nicht mehr primär in Büchern, sondern vor \nallem in Zeitschriften  veröffentlicht werden. Daher kann heute im Rahmen des wissen-\nschaftlichen Arbeitens auf ein breites Spektr um an wissenschaftlichen Zeitschriften in \nden unterschiedlichsten Fachgebieten zurückgegriffen werden. Darunter befinden sich \nviele Fachzeitschriften, in denen vor allem Spezialthemen behandelt werden.\nZu den wichtigsten wirtschaftswissenschaftlichen Zeitschriften zählen Periodika wie \nz. B.:\n– Journal of Finance,\n– Journal of Institutional and Theoretical Economics \n– Zeitschrift für die gesamte Staatswissenschaft,\n– Journal of Marketing,– FinanzArchiv,\n– German Economic Review,\n– Managementforschung Jahrbuch,– ZfbF Schmalenbachs Zeitschrift für betriebswirtschaftliche Forschung,\n– Wirtschaftsinformatik (früher: Angewandte Informatik),\n– Marketing, Zeitschrift für Forschung und Praxis ZFP,– Zeitschrift für Betriebswirtschaft ZfB,\n– Die Betriebswirtschaft DBW,\n–u . a .\nUm die Bedeutung der deutschen wirtschaftswissenschaftlichen Forschung richtig ein-\nzuordnen, muss man in Betracht ziehen, dass die wichtigste deutsche Zeitschrift im \ninternationalen Zusammenhang nur auf Rang 65 steht und die Topränge fast ausschließ-\nlich von amerikanischen Journals belegt werden.Bibliografien sind Zusammenstellungen von Literatur, also im Grunde Verzeich-nisse. Diese Verzeichnisse können ganz unterschiedlich gestaltet sein. Die Kriterien \nhierbei betreffen z. B. die thematische Ausrichtung, den zeitlichen Rahmen und die \nAusführlichkeit. Für Ihre Recherche, die im übrigen selbst auf eine „kleine“ Biblio-grafie hinausläuft (das spätere Literaturverzeichnis Ihrer Arbeit), kann der Umgang mit Bibliografien besonders am Anfang hilfreich sein, um Bücher mit bestimmten \nTitelschlagworten zu finden.\nNeben den Allgemeinbibliografien  sollte beim wissenschaftlichen Arbeiten unbe-\ndingt auch von Fachbibliografien Gebrauch gemacht werden. In ihnen werden Pub-\nlikationen zu einem speziellen Fach verzeichnet, was sich für eine gezielte Suche nur vorteilhaft auswirken kann.	{"source": "book.pdf", "page": 17}	b47ae76c-845d-11ee-87d1-5686f88fa7cd	db958014-1454-4e9e-a7f8-dc9e6330e468

1\nåSQL301Aber auch in anderen Fachrichtungen ist die thematische Vielfalt der Fachzeitschriften \nnicht geringer. Die nachfolgende Tabelle zeigt, wie viele Zeitschriften zu ausgewählten \nThemen zur Verfügung stehen.\nTabelle 1:\nZeitschriften zu ausge-\nwählten Themenfeldern\n(vgl. Elektronische Zeit-\nschriftenbibliothek, 2009).\nEine beträchtliche Anzahl von wissenschaftlichen Aufsätzen erscheint in diesen Zeit-\nschriften. In den Allgemeinbibliografien werden aber längst nicht alle einzelnen Auf-\nsätze verzeichnet. Aus diesem Grund gibt es Zeitschriftenbibliografien, die auf die inne-ren Bestände der Zeitschriften spezialisiert sind. Da sie ein unverzichtbar gewordenes \nMittel der Recherche geworden sind, wird nun ein kurzer Überblick über die wichtigs-\nten Zeitschriftenbibliografien gegeben und diese kurz beschrieben.\nDie \nZeitschriftendatenbank (ZDB)  der Deutschen Bibliothek ist eine Datenbank, in der \nmehr als 1,2 Millionen Titel in unterschiedlichen Sprachen ohne Volltexte verzeichnet \nstehen. Der über diese Datenbank abrufbare Pool von gedruckten und elektronischen Zeitschriften bezeigt den oder die Standorte, an welchen der jeweilige recherchierte \nTitel zu finden und ggf. zu bestellen ist. Um über die Relevanz einer Zeitschrift für die \nRecherche klarer zu sehen, kann der Versuch unternommen werden, ob der über die Zeitschriftendatenbank (ZDB) herausgefundene Standort entweder einen Volltext \nonline zur Verfügung stellt oder aber weiterführende Informationen dazu anbietet. Der \nzur Zeitschriftendatenbank (ZDB) hinführende Link lautet http://dispatch.opac.ddb.de.\nDie \nElektronische Zeitschriftenbibliothek der Universität Regensburg (EZB Regensburg)  ist eine \nKooperation von über 300 deutschen und internationalen Bibliotheken und Forschungs-\neinrichtungen, wobei die Universität Regensburg die technische Betreuung innehat. Unter der URL http://rzblx1.uni-regensburg.de/ezeit/ we rden hier alle Zeitschriften verzeichnet, \ndie Volltextartikel anbieten, wobei ein Am pelsystem Auskunft über die Zugriffsmöglich-\nkeiten der jeweiligen Volltexte gibt. Während viele Zeitschriften allen Nutzern zur Ver-\nfügung stehen, sind einige auf bestimmte Nutz ergruppen beschränkt. Wiederum andere \nbieten gar keinen Zugriff auf Volltexte. In Summe stehen rund 25 000 Zeitschriften frei \nzur Verfügung, davon allein über 2600 aus dem Fachbereich Wirtschaftswissenschaften.\nNahezu alle deutschen Bibliotheken sind an diesem Projekt beteiligt ebenso wie viele \nInstituts- und Spezialbibliotheken.

1\nåSQL301Bei EconBiz – Die Virtuelle Fachbibl iothek Wirtschaftswissenschaften  (http://www. econbiz.de) \nhandelt es sich um einen von der Deutschen Zentralbibliothek für Wirtschaftswissen-\nschaften (ZBW) und der Universitäts- und Stadtbibliothek Köln angebotenen Fach-\ninformationsführer. Als solcher bietet er eine Sammlung von Internetquellen, die nach bestimmten Qualitätskriterien individuel l ausgewählt werden. Die Wirtschaftswissen-\nschaften bilden, wie der Name schon sagt, den fachlichen Schwerpunkt von EconBiz, \nwobei jede einzelne Quelle von wissenschaftlichem und bibliothekarischem Fach-\npersonal auf Tauglichkeit überprüft wird.\nEconBiz ist in die Hauptrubriken Internetquellenverzeichnis, Volltexte, Kataloge und \nDatenbanken sowie Dienste unterteilt. Letzteres enthält einen Veranstaltungskalender, \nZugang zur Volltextdatenbank EconDoc sowie Dokumentlieferdienste für Bücher und \nAufsätze, Literaturrecherchedienste und Literaturzusammenstellungen, die zum Teil kostenpflichtig sind.\nK[26] Wie kann nach Aufsätzen, die in Zeitschriften veröffentlicht wurden, recherchiert werden?\n1.1.5\nWebsuchmaschinen\nMit der Verbreitung des Internets entstanden viele neue Möglichkeiten, um Publikatio-\nnen und auch um Graue Literatur aufzufinden. Gerade bei Themen mit aktuellen Bezü-\ngen ist eine Internetrecherche heute unumgänglich. Dabei werden Suchmaschinen ein-gesetzt. Diese Suchmaschinen lassen sich wiederum nach verschiedenen Kriterien \nsystematisieren. Ganz grob lassen sich die Suchmaschinen unterscheiden in Inhalte in \nTexten, Bildern, Videos und Tonaufnahmen. Je nach der verwendeten Suchmaschine fallen dann die Ergebnisse anders aus. Suchmaschinen können aber auch unterschieden \nwerden nach der Datenquelle, die durchsucht wird. So gibt es Enterprise-Search-Such-\nmaschinen, die alle relevanten Daten in einem Unternehmen durchsuchen. Websuch-maschinen erfassen alle Daten, die im World Wide Web zu finden sind. Intranet-Such-\nmaschinen greifen auf Informationen in einem abgegrenzten, nicht öffentlichen \nNetzwerk von Rechnern zu. Schließlich lässt sich nach dem Betrieb der Suchmaschinen unterscheiden zwischen\n– Indexsuchmaschinen und\n– Katalogsuchmaschinen.\nBei den heute gängigen Suchmaschinen handelt es sich um sogenannte Indexsuch-\nmaschinen. Bestimmte Programme, die als „Crawler“ oder „Spider“ bezeichnet werden, analysieren Daten direkt in den Dokumenten und Seiten des ausgewählten Netzwerks. \nMeistens erstreckt sich die Suche auf das gesamte World Wide Web.

1\nåSQL301versuchen, die wesentlichen Informationen oder Schlüsselwörter einer Website oder \neines Dokuments zu extrahieren. Die Ergebnisse werden dann quasi in einem giganti-\nschen Index abgespeichert. Bei einer Suchanfrage greifen die Programme dann auf den \nIndex zurück und präsentieren die Trefferliste. Das bekannteste Beispiel für diese Art von Suchmaschinen ist Google. Der Vorteil ist, dass der Suchvorgang relativ schnell ausgeführt wird, da eine sehr große Menge an Daten indexiert werden kann. Anderer-\nseits ist die Indexierung der Daten und die Pflege des Datenbestandes sehr aufwendig, \nda Informationsquellen ständig durchsucht werden müssen, um die Suchmaschine stets auf dem aktuellen Stand zu halten.\nKatalogsuchmaschinen\nBei der Katalogsuchmaschine erfolgt die Suche nicht direkt im Dokument. Hier bieten \nvon Redaktionen erstellte Kataloge die Grundlage der Suche. Was diese Redaktionen erstellen sind Dokumentbeschreibungen und hierarchische Tabellen, denen eine spezi-\nelle Gliederung zugrunde liegt, anhand derer die Suche immer weiter spezifiziert wird. \nYahoo! ist ein Beispiel für eine solche Suchmaschinenart.\nDer Vorteil der Katalogsuchmaschine besteht darin, dass der Suchende gezielter vor-\ngehen kann. Die Voraussetzung für ein derartig gezieltes Suchen ist, dass die Vorstel-\nlungen möglichst genau sind, nach denen die Suche gestaltet wird. Eine Kombination \nbeider Suchmaschinenarten mit der tendenziellen Gewichtung, dass die Indexsuch-maschine den Einstieg einer Recherche bildet und die Katalogsuchmaschine den \ngezielten Fortgang, nachdem die Suchvorstellung an Präzision gewonnen hat, kann \neine mögliche Vorgehensweise im Umgang mit Suchmaschinen im Internet sein.\nDas Problem, mit dem eine jede Suche über Websuchmaschinen umzugehen hat, ist die \nin der Regel unüberschaubare Datenmenge, mit welcher der Suchende konfrontiert \nwird. Die Anzahl der Suchergebnisse überstei gt häufig den Rahmen der eigenen Auf-\nnahmefähigkeit. Hier kommt es auf intelligente Filter  und Suchalgorithmen  an, die \nsicherstellen, dass die Spreu vom Weizen getrennt wird. Denn sonst ist das Internet mit \nseiner Informationsvielfalt mehr Fluch als Segen für die wissenschaftliche Arbeit.\nSuchfilter  sollen sicherstellen, dass man nicht alle Quellen zur Kenntnis nehmen muss, \nsondern annäherungsweise nur die relevanten Quellen. Und da die Suchmaschine nicht ahnen kann, was die Frau oder der Mann vor dem Computer genau sucht, „spuckt“ sie \nerst einmal alles aus, was zur Suchanfrage passt. Hierdurch wird deutlich, dass die Defi-\nnition der Suchanfrage direkt verantwortlich ist für die Qualität der Ergebnisse. Über die Suchanfrage bestimmt der User seine Suche und schickt die Suchmaschinen mit ih-\nren Spidern, Robotern und Agenten auf Expedition. Es ist von enormem Nutzen, auf die \nSuchanfrage einige Zeit und viele gute Gedanken zu verwenden. Denn im Gegenzug wird sie einem dadurch jede Menge Zeit ersparen, da man sich nicht mehr oder erheb-\nlich weniger mit der handverlesenen Auswahl relevanter Quellen herumplagen muss, \num sich in dem Wust der irrelevanten Treffer zurechtzufinden.\nMan tut gut daran, sich mit der jeweiligen Suchmaschine, mit der man gerade arbeitet, \nvertraut zu machen.

1\nåSQL301Parameter Über die Funktion „erweiterte Suche“ lassen sich in der Regel folgende Parameter  \ndurch den User frei wählen:\nPErgebnisse anzeigen mit\n– all diesen Wörtern– der exakten Phrase\n– einem dieser Wörter\n– keinem dieser Wörter\nPAktualisiert\nPWebsite/Domain\nPDateiformat\nPFamilienfilter\nPLand\nPSprachen\nPTrefferzahl pro Seite\nPLizenzierung\nLogische\nVerknüpfungenÜber die „normale“ Suche lassen sich durch die Verwendung von Kurzbefehlen Such-\nvorgänge spezifizieren. Diese Kurzbefehle sind nicht bei allen Suchmaschinen gleich. \nJedoch haben sich einige dieser logischen Verknüpfungen  weitgehend durchgesetzt.\nP„+“ oder „AND“ für die Verknüpfung  zweier oder mehrerer Suchwörter, von denen \nzwingend alle in dem Dokument vorkommen.\nP„–„ oder „NOT“ zum Ausschluss  des negierten Suchworts, das in dem Dokument \nzwingend nicht vorkommt.\nPIn Anführungszeichen zusammengesetzte Suchwörter bilden eine Phrase , die in die-\nser Zusammensetzung, also nicht in verstreuter Form, in dem Dokument vorkommen \nmuss, damit die Suche einen Treffer verzeichnet.Beispiel: „globale Erderwärmung“ oder „Unwort des Jahres 2010“– „~“+“Zahl“ in direktem Anschluss an eine Phrase gestattet die Unterbrechung der \nWörter in der Phrase durch die Wortanzahl von unter „Zahl“ festgesetzten Wör-\ntern.Beispiel: „Die Tetrade von Marshall McLuhan“~3 nimmt auch Treffer in die \nSuche auf, bei denen zwischen „Tetrade“ und „McLuhan“ etwa ein bis drei such-\nfremde  Wörter auftauchen.\nP„OR“ leitet die Suchmaschine dahingehend an, dass diese Treffer aus der Suche her-\nausfiltert, in denen mindestens  eins der genannten Wörter auftaucht (also nicht zwin-\ngend alle wie bei „AND“ bzw. „+“.)\nP„*“ gestattet es der Suchmaschine, innerhalb eines Wortes beliebig zu vervollständi-\ngen. In der Regel müssen mindestens drei Zeichen dem Wildcard -Zeichen „*“ voran-\ngestellt sein.(Beispiel: zu „Länder*“ wird „Länderspiel“, „Länderfrage“ u.v.m. gefunden).\n– „?“ veranlasst die Suchmaschine, um ein Zeichen zu ergänzen.\nBeispiel: „Rom?“ wird u. a. „Roma“ und „Romy“ ergeben.\nP„(xORy)“: Durch die Klammer können alternative Verknüpfungsmöglichkeiten  gege-\nben werden.\nBeispiel: „Bundeskanzler AND (Schröder OR Schmidt)“. Hierbei werden alle Seiten als Treffer verbucht, in denen einer der beiden Bundeskanzler genannt wird.	{"source": "book.pdf", "page": 22}	b47ae7ee-845d-11ee-87d1-5686f88fa7cd	88c059c9-3c74-4c72-9fbc-ce832ee79c45

1\nåSQL301P„^“ dient der Schwerpunktsetzung.\nBeispiel: „Waldsterben Deutschland Nadelbäume^“. Hier werden die Treffer oben \nauf der Trefferliste erscheinen, in denen neben „Waldsterben“ und „Deutschland“ \nebenfalls die hier mit dem Schwerpunkt-Zeichen versehenen „Nadelbäume“ genannt werden.\nFür die Suche nach wissenschaftlichen Texten werden im Internet spezielle Such-\nmaschinen angeboten. Als Suchgrundlage dienen insbesondere die Server von wissen-\nschaftlichen Institutionen. Vorteil dieser Suchmaschinen gegenüber digitalen Bibliothe-ken etwa ist, dass hier auch die Graue Literatur erfassbar gemacht wird, wodurch sich \ndie Verfügbarkeit der in die Recherche einzubeziehenden Quellen maßgeblich erhöht. \nZwei Beispiele von Suchmaschinen, die auf wissenschaftliche Arbeiten spezialisiert sind: http://scholar.google.de/ und http://www.base-search.net/\nErstere Suchmaschine gehört zur Produktpalette von Google, letztere ist die Bielefeld \nAcademic Search Engine, deren Anbieter die Universitätsbibliothek Bielefeld ist. Beide \nsollten Sie in die Recherche mit einbeziehen, da auch hier eine Fülle von zum Teil aktuellstem Material dargeboten wird, darunter auch die sonst schwer auffindbare \nGraue Literatur.\nK[8] Welche Arten von Websuchmaschinen sind Ihnen bekannt?\nK[28] Warum sollte man bei der Recherche zu einer wissenschaftlichen Arbeit auch von \nWebsuchmaschinen Gebrauch machen?Informationen im Internet lassen sich mithilfe von Suchmaschinen finden. Dabei wird zwischen Index- und Katalogsuchmaschinen unterschieden. Die Indexsuch-\nmaschinen analysieren Daten direkt in den Dokumenten und Seiten des Internets, \num einen gigantischen Index zu schaffen. Dadurch ist der Suchvorgang schnell, doch ist die Indizierung sehr aufwendig.\nKatalogsuchmaschinen orientieren sich an Katalogen, die eine Redaktion erstellt hat. \nEin gezielteres Suchen ist damit möglich. Allerdings setzt die gezielte Suche bereits \nein bestimmtes Grundwissen voraus.\nDie kaum überschaubare Fülle an Treffern einer Suchmaschine lässt sich etwas \neinschränken durch den Einsatz von logischen Verknüpfungen und die Nutzung der \nFunktion „erweiterte Suche“. Die logischen Verknüpfungen beruhen auf der \nBool’schen Algebra, wie z.

1\nåSQL3011.1.6\nVolltextdatenbanken\nVolltextdatenbanken bieten komplette Texte. Darunter befinden sich beispielsweise \nganze Zeitschriftenartikel und vollständige Dissertationen. Diese können bequem einge-sehen und auf den eigenen Computer geladen werden. Volltextdatenbanken ermögli-\nchen damit eine sofortige Materialbeschaffung, was natürlich gegenüber anderen Be-\nschaffungswegen (z. B. bei Bibliotheken) von großem Vorteil ist. Im Folgenden geben wir Ihnen eine Auswahl von Volltextdatenbanken, die Ihnen bei Recherche und Materi-\nalbeschaffung sehr nützlich sein können.\nDie \nEBSCO-Datenbanken  (URL: http://search.ebscohost.com/) erlauben den Zugriff auf \ndie wichtigsten internationalen wirtschaftswissenschaftlichen Zeitschriftenaufsätze. EBSCO umfasst mehr als eintausend Journals aus den meisten Bereichen der BWL und \nVWL, für die teilweise die Beiträge im PDF-Format zur Verfügung gestellt werden. Der \nZugang ist kostenpflichtig. Nach dem Einloggen bei EBSCO müssen Sie eine Daten-bank auswählen. Hier empfiehlt sich die Auswahl „Business Source Elite“, da die „Re-\ngional Business News“ sehr viel populäre Literatur enthält, die für wissenschaftliche \nArbeiten keine große Relevanz besitzen.

1\nåSQL301EBSCO bietet neben der Aufsatzsammlung den Dienst, nach Firmenprofilen zu suchen. \nHier ist es möglich, innerhalb eines sehr großen Spektrums nach einer Firma zu suchen \nund nähere Informationen zu dieser zu erhalten. Klicken Sie den Button „Firmenpro-\nfile“ und starten Sie die Suche. Aus einer alphabetisch geordneten Liste können Sie aus etwa 10 000 internationalen Unternehmen Ihre Auswahl treffen. Berichte und Informati-onen, die Sie erhalten, beinhalten z. B. Daten zum Unternehmen, dessen Umfeld sowie \nSWOT-Analysen. Sie liegen als PDF vor und können so bequem sofort eingesehen und \nggf. gespeichert und gedruckt werden.\nEine sehr bedeutende Zusammenstellung wirtschafts- und sozialwissenschaftlicher \nLiteraturnachweise stellt \nwiso (http://www.wiso-net.de) dar. Wiso weist mehr als 5 Mio. \nQuelltexte aus 340 Zeitschriften nach. Auch differenzierte Unternehmensinformationen \nkönnen Sie über wiso einsehen. Wiso ist ein kostenpflichtiger Dienst, kann aber in vie-len öffentlichen Hochschulen von lokalen Rechnern aus kostenfrei genutzt werden.\nEine weitere kostenpflichtige Volltextdatenbank ist \nEconDoc  (http://www.genios.de), die \nein Dienst des Online-Informationsverbunds wirtschaftswissenschaftlicher Bibliothe-ken und Verlage in Deutschland ist. Mehrere Projektpartner verknüpfen hier ihre Daten-\nbanken aus dem Bereich der Wirtschaftswissenschaft und der Wirtschaftspraxis mitein-\nander, woraus sich ein Onlineangebot aus elektronischen Volltexten ergibt. Bei einem Angebot von über 2 Mio. Dokumenten ist also auch hier eine wahre Fundgrube für die \nRecherche gegeben.\nWikipedia  ist nicht im eigentlichen Sinn eine Volltextdatenbank. Da es sich aber auch \nhier um eine Datenbank handelt, die direkten Zugriff auf vollständige Texte, oder \ngenauer: Wissensartikel der Enzyklopädie, anbietet, soll an dieser Stelle darauf einge-\ngangen werden.\nWikipedia ist ein beliebtes Instrument, sich in Wissensfragen kundig zu machen. Da bei \nder Recherche immer wieder neue Fragen entstehen, und es überhaupt um Wissen geht, \nwird mancher auf die Idee kommen, Wikipedia zu befragen. Warum auch nicht? Aller-\ndings ist die Benutzung von Wikipedia für das wissenschaftliche Arbeiten nicht unprob-lematisch.\nEiner der Ansprüche einer wissenschaftlichen Arbeit besteht darin, auf verlässliche \nQuellen zurückzugreifen. Sie müssen nachvollziehbar sein. Aus diesem Grund werden \ndie Quellen in einer wissenschaftlichen Arbeit belegt. Wikipedia ist eine freie Enzyklo-pädie. „Frei“ heißt hier, dass jeder als Verfasser auftreten und seinen Text bei Wikipe-\ndia veröffentlichen kann. Für den Anwender von Wikipedia heißt das aber, dass das, \nwas in den Quellen steht, nur mit äußerster Vorsicht zu betrachten ist. Es gibt keine echte Kontrolle der Quellen und das kann zu peinlichen Falschaussagen führen. Aber \nfür einen Einstieg in eine Thematik eignet sich Wikipedia hervorragend.

1\nåSQL301B Wie leicht man auf Fehler in Wikipedia hereinfallen kann, musste selbst SPIEGEL \nONLINE erfahren, als dieser die Vornamen des damaligen Wirtschaftsministers \nZUGUTTENBERG  abdrucken wollte. Ein Auszug aus dem Beitrag, mit dem SPIEGEL \nONLINE sich entschuldigen musste (o. V. 2009, Internetquelle):\n„Falscher Wilhelm bei Minister Guttenberg\nKarl Theodor Maria Nikolaus Johann Jakob Philipp Franz Joseph Sylvester Freiherr \nvon und zu Guttenberg: So heißt der neue Wirtschaftsminister. Aber nicht auch noch \nWilhelm. SPIEGEL ONLINE ist auf einen Fälscher hereingefallen, der den Eintrag \ndes CSU-Politikers in Wikipedia verändert hatte. […]\nHintergrund: Ein Fälscher, der sich inzwischen in einem Blog damit brüstet, hatte \nin der Internet-Enzyklopädie Wikipedia den Guttenberg-Eintrag verändert. Und SPIEGEL ONLINE ist auf diese Fälschung hereingefallen. […].“\nIm Rahmen Ihrer Arbeit sollten Sie unbedingt vermeiden, auf solch einen Schwindel \nhereinzufallen – zumal es sich auch um wichtigere Dinge drehen kann, als den elften \nVornamen eines Ministers.\nK[35] Was ist eine Volltextdatenbank?\nK[16] Warum ist Wikipedia für die Recherche nicht unproblematisch?\nSie haben in diesem Abschnitt die Vorzüge der Volltextdatenbanken kennengelernt: sie \nversorgen Sie sogleich mit dem benötigten Material. Allerdings sind längst nicht alle Texte auf Datenbanken erhältlich, schon gar nicht kostenfrei. Daher bleiben Bibliothe-\nken als Quelle der Materialbeschaffung unerlässlich.\n1.1.7\nBibliotheken\nBibliotheken sind traditionell erster Anlaufpunkt, um eine wissenschaftliche Arbeit an-\nzufertigen. Das Aufkommen des Internets, der Datenträger und Datenbanken hat zwar die Stellung der Bibliotheken, die quasi eine Monopolstellung war, eindeutig verändert. Volltextdatenbanken leisten einen besonderen Dienst: Sie stellen ihren Besuchern – kostenfrei oder kostenpflichtig – das recherchierte Material in Form einer Datei zur \nVerfügung. Zeitlich ist das Beziehen von Texten aus Volltextdatenbanken extrem \nökonomisch, da hier die sonst separat ablaufenden Teilprozesse der Recherche, Materialsuche und Materialbeschaffung, Hand in Hand gehen können.\nArtikel aus der freien Internet-Enzyklopädie Wikipedia können als Einstieg in die \nRecherche verwendet werden. Da die Quellen hier allerdings schwer oder gar nicht \nzu kontrollieren sind, sollten sie unbedingt im Fall einer Verwendung durch verläss-liche Quellen abgesichert und ersetzt werden.	{"source": "book.pdf", "page": 26}	b47ae83e-845d-11ee-87d1-5686f88fa7cd	b91f80ae-2757-4919-b2f8-d3a78d31cfaf

1\nåSQL301Trotzdem sind die Bibliotheken bis heute nicht aus dem wissenschaftlichen und studen-\ntischen Alltag wegzudenken.\nMan unterscheidet folgende Formen von Bibliotheken:\n– Hochschulbibliotheken an Universitäten und Fachhochschulen– Fachbibliotheken in den jeweiligen Fachbereichen einer Hochschule\n– Nationalbibliotheken (z. B. Deutsche Nationalbibliothek)\n– Öffentliche Bibliotheken (z. B. Stadtbüchereien)– Private Bibliotheken (z. B. Bibliotheken von Unternehmen und Institutionen)\nFür das wissenschaftliche Arbeiten kann jede der genannten Bibliotheken relevante \nQuellen liefern, wobei sich die Nützlichkeit über die Art des Forschungsprojekts defi-\nniert. So ist beispielsweise für eine stark theoretisch orientierte Arbeit das Aufsuchen \nvon Stadtbüchereien und Jugendbibliotheken weniger sinnvoll, hingegen werden die wissenschaftlichen Bibliotheken wie die Hochschulbibliotheken, die Fachbibliotheken \nund die Nationalbibliotheken von großem Nutzen sein. Bei einer empirischen Arbeit, \ndie einen starken Praxisbezug hat und beispielsweise für ein Unternehmen vorgenom-men wird, könnte die private Bibliothek des Unternehmens, in deren Bestand interne \nBerichte und dergleichen vorliegen, sehr hilfreich sein. Der jeweilige Fall, das jeweilige \nForschungsszenario entscheidet hier darüber, welche Bibliothek verwendet werden sollte und von welcher keine neuen Impulse zu erwarten sind.\nDie meisten Bibliotheken teilen ihre angebotenen Titel in einen Präsenz- und einen \nLeihbestand (Freihandbestand) ein. Die zum Präsenzbestand  gehörigen Quellen lassen \nsich nur vor Ort einsehen, was den Vorteil hat, dass sie verlässlich immer im Haus sind \nund, sofern kein anderer Nutzer sie gerade verwendet, jederzeit zur Verfügung stehen. Will man den Text aber mit nach Hause nehmen, muss man sich eine Kopie machen.\nDer Leihbestand , der sich entweder zur Einsicht der Nutzer in den für ihn nutzbaren \nRäumlichkeiten befindet oder in den Magazinen, aus denen er sie erst gegen das Ausfül-\nlen einer Bestellung erhalten kann, hat den Vorteil, dass die zur Entleihung stehenden Medien mit nach Hause genommen werden dürfen. Für alle, die nicht so gerne in Bib-\nliotheken arbeiten oder auch gerne außerhalb der Öffnungszeiten, ist dies ein erhebli-\ncher Vorteil.\nFernleihe Medien, die nicht zum Bibliotheksbestand vor Ort gehören, können in der Regel über Fernleihe bestellt werden. Hierbei bestellt die Bibliothek vor Ort gegen Gebühr das ge-\nwünschte Medium aus einer anderen Bibliothek, in deren Bestand es sich befindet, und \nstellt dieses dem eigenen Nutzer für einen begrenzten Zeitraum zur Verfügung.\nBibliotheken spielen wegen ihres umfangreichen und differenzierten Medienbestan-\ndes eine wichtige Rolle in der Recherche. Auch Medien, die in der Bibliothek vor \nOrt nicht erhältlich sind, können meist per Fernleihe beschafft werden.

1\nåSQL301K[19] Welche Formen von Bibliotheken kennen Sie? Nennen Sie drei Beispiele.\nK[30] Was ist der „Präsenzbestand“ einer Bibliothek?\n1.2\nLektüre\nNach Recherche und Materialbeschaffung ist die Lektüre  der nächste Schritt. Hierbei \nunterscheidet sich das Lesen von Freizeitlektüre ganz erheblich vom Lesen wissen-\nschaftlicher Quellen. Vielleicht haben Sie schon die eine oder andere Lesetechnik ange-\nwendet und wissen, dass nicht jede Textpassage mit der gleichen Intensität gelesen wer-den muss, um einen guten Überblick über einen Text zu bekommen. So liest man eine \nTageszeitung ja auch anders als einen spannenden Roman. Nur macht man es sich nicht \nunbedingt bewusst, dass hierbei unterschiedliche Techniken angewendet werden. Man schlägt die Zeitung oder das Buch auf und liest einfach.\nBeim wissenschaftlichen Arbeiten haben Sie es aber nicht mehr mit einem Buch oder \neiner Zeitung zu tun, die Sie aus eigenem Interesse lesen und für die Sie sich die Zeit \nfrei einteilen können. Sie müssen eine große Menge von Texten bewältigen, bei denen \nSie überdies nicht genau wissen, welcher Teil wie wichtig für das Thema ist.\nEiner der Ansprüche einer wissenschaftlichen Arbeit ist es, salopp gesagt: viel zu lesen. \nZu den meisten Themen gibt es bereits eine Menge Literatur. Oben haben wir bereits \nerwähnt, dass Wissenschaft eine Wissensgemeinschaft bilden will, in die auch Sie sich \nintegrieren sollten. Das wiederum bedeutet, die Arbeiten anderer auf Erkenntnisse zu durchsuchen, die für die eigene Arbeit hilfreich sein können. Auf diese Weise müssen \nSie das Rad nicht jedes Mal neu erfinden, sondern können auf Bewährtes zurückgreifen. \nAn Ihnen ist es jedoch, zu beurteilen, ob sich das jeweils Gelesene auch in Ihrer Arbeit bewähren wird.\nEs gibt Ansätze, die Lesegeschwindigkeit zu steigern, indem die „words per minute“ \nerhöht werden. Derartige Übungen wollen wir in diesem Studienbrief nicht machen. \nGleichwohl wollen wir Ihnen dabei helfen, die Effizienz Ihrer Lesesitzungen zu stei-\ngern. Wenn Sie sich die Lesetechniken, die wir Ihnen vorstellen, (die Sie, wie gesagt, intuitiv schon kennen), bewusst machen und diese dann auch bewusst einsetzen und \nüben, werden Sie viel Zeit sparen und gute Ergebnisse erzielen.\nAber selbst wenn Sie ein Profi im Umgang mit den Lesetechniken sind, ist Lesen und \nVerstehen ein aufwendiger Vorgang. In Ihrer Planung für ein wissenschaftliches Projekt sollten Sie stets hinreichend Zeit für die Lektüre einrechnen. Lesen hat auch immer \netwas mit Nachdenken zu tun und vorschnelle Urteile sind leider meistens auch falsche \nUrteile.\nIm Folgenden werden Sie zunächst einen allgemeinen Überblick über mögliche Lese-\ntechniken erhalten. Darauf werden diejenigen Lesetechniken eingehender betrachtet, \ndie für das wissenschaftliche Lesen relevant sind.

1\nåSQL3011.2.1\nAllgemeine Lesetechniken\nBeim Lesen eines Textes lassen sich fünf verschiedene Lesetechniken  unterscheiden. Es \ngibt– das punktuelle,\n– das sequenzielle,\n– das diagonale,– das kursorische und\n– das intensive Lesen.\nIm Grunde stellen diese Techniken unterschiedliche Umgangsformen mit Texten vor.\nPunktuelles Lesen Beim punktuellen Lesen  werden nur Teile des Textes gelesen. Der Leser „springt“ von \neinem Punkt zum nächsten, ohne alle Ausführungen mitzuverfolgen. So ist das punk-tuelle Lesen von einer Vielzahl von Unterbrechungen gekennzeichnet, es springt von \neiner Stelle zur nächsten, an der es dann fortgesetzt wird. Es wird beispielsweise bei \nHypertexten verwendet, bei denen es sich aufgrund ihrer nichtlinearen Textstruktur be-sonders anbietet.\nSequenzielles Lesen Anders verhält es sich beim sequenziellen Lesen . Hier folgt das Lesen dem linearen \nTextfluss (ohne Unterbrechungen bzw. Sprünge). Die vollständige Lektüre eines Textes \nbasiert auf sequenziellem Lesen. Ein typisches Beispiel für die Anwendung dieser Lese-\ntechnik ist der Roman – vorausgesetzt, dass dieser den Leser „fesselt“.\nDiagonales Lesen Bei diagonalem Lesen  findet ein rasches Überfliegen des Textes statt. Dabei kommt es \nzu einem Erfassen der wichtigsten Textinhalte und Textstrukturen. Es kann mit sequen-\nziellem Lesen einhergehen, aber nur stichprobenartig (Anlesen). Ein Anwendungsbei-spiel dieser Lesetechnik ist in der Zeitungslektüre zu sehen.\nKursorisches Lesen Das kursorische Lesen  bezeichnet eine weitere Lesetechnik, bei der eine vollständige \nLektüre des Textes erfolgt. Dabei wird meist die Technik des sequenziellen Lesens ver-\nwendet. Hierbei werden Hervorhebungen am Text vorgenommen (Markierungen und \ndergleichen), mit denen der Leser sich den Text anzueignen versucht. Diese Lesetech-nik, wie auch die folgende, ist typisch für das Lesen und Erarbeiten wissenschaftlicher \nTexte.\nIntensives Lesen Das intensive Lesen  findet auf der Basis des sequenziellen Lesens statt. Dabei wird das \ngenaue und vollständige Erfassen des Textes bezweckt. Der Leser studiert den Text \nunter bestimmten Aspekten.\nFür das wissenschaftliche Arbeiten ist es unbedingt erforderlich, eine bewusste Anwen-\ndung unterschiedlicher Lesetechniken zu üben. Während der beginnenden Recherche wird hauptsächlich von der punktuellen und der diagonalen Lesetechnik Gebrauch \ngemacht, um einen Überblick über das gesammelte Material zu bekommen. Sobald man \naber einen guten Überblick hat, gilt es, einzelne Fragestellungen und Aspekte zur Arbeit vertieft zu erarbeiten. Hier ist meist ein Wechselspiel von kursorischem und intensivem \nLesen erforderlich. Auf diese Lesetechniken kann beim wissenschaftlichen Arbeiten \nnicht verzichtet werden.

1\nåSQL301Betrachten Sie zuvor die folgende Übersicht über die eben geschilderten Lesetechniken.\nTabelle 2:\nÜbersicht über die Lese-\ntechniken. Quelle: Vgl.\nhttp://www.teachsam.de/\narb/arb_les_tec1_1.htm.\nK[31] Welche Merkmale zeichnen das sequenzielle Lesen aus? Welches Anwendungsbeispiel \nfällt Ihnen zu dieser Lesetechnik ein?\n1.2.2\nLesen wissenschaftlicher Texte\nWissenschaftliche Texte sind in der Regel anspruchsvoll. Daher stellt ein jeder Lese-\nvorgang eine mehr oder minder große Herausforderung für den Leser dar. Das Ziel von \nLesetechniken besteht darin, ein möglichst effizientes Lesen zu ermöglichen.\nBeim Lesen wissenschaftlicher Texte wird eigentlich von allen oben geschilderten \nLesetechniken Gebrauch gemacht. Bei der Recherche kommt, insbesondere durch den \nUmgang mit Hypertexten, Bibliografien und dergleichen, das punktuelle Lesen zum Tragen. Sobald die relevanten Materialien auf diesem Wege identifiziert sind und vor-\nliegen, können sie eingehend durchgearbeitet werden. Das geschieht besonders durch \neine Kombination der Techniken des diagonalen, kursorischen und intensiven Lesens (wobei letztere das sequenzielle Lesen mit einschließen).\nIn diesem Abschnitt werden Sie Beispiele finden, wie die Techniken miteinander kom-\nbiniert werden können und durch welches Denken (Fragen, Anforderungen an den \nText) dies begleitet werden kann.\nUm herauszufinden, welche Bücher, Zeitschriftenartikel, Forschungsberichte oder \nInternetveröffentlichungen für die eigenen wissenschaftlichen Zwecke brauchbar sind, Lesetechnik Merkmale\npunktuelles Lesen Teilweises Lesen, Lesevorgang wird unterbrochen und an anderer \nStelle fortgesetzt, „Springen“, Sinnzusammenhang wird erschlos-\nsen.\nsequenzielles Lesen Vollständige Lektüre des Textes, Lesevorgang folgt dem linearen \nTextfluss.\ndiagonales Lesen Rasches Überfliegen des Textes, Erfassen der wichtigsten Text-\ninhalte und Textstrukturen.\nkursorisches Lesen Vollständige Lektüre des Textes, meist auf Basis sequenziellen \nLesens; am Text arbeiten mit Hervorbringungen (Markierungen \nund dergleichen).\nintensives Lesen Genaues und vollständiges Erfassen des Textes auf der Basis \nsequenziellen Lesens; Lektüre wird durch spezielle Fragen an den \nText begleitet.\nLesen ist nicht gleich Lesen: Es gibt fünf Lesetechniken , die unterschieden werden \nkönnen. Jede stellt eine andere Umgangsform mit einem Text dar. Neben dem punk-\ntuellen, sequenziellen und diagonalen Lesen gibt es das kursorische und das inten-sive Lesen.

1\nåSQL301müssen nicht alle Texte intensiv gelesen werden. Sobald die Materialien vorliegen, kön-\nnen diese zunächst punktuell bzw. diagonal gelesen und auf diesem Wege eingestuft \nwerden. Diese Einstufung folgt, einfach gesagt, der Fragestellung: „Ist dieser Text für \nmein Thema bzw. wissenschaftliches Arbeiten relevant? Wenn ja, für welchen Aspekt meiner Arbeit ist er relevant?“\nEinen guten Eindruck von einer Quelle bekommt man, wenn man sich die folgenden \nFragen beantwortet (vgl. Balzert et al., 2008, S. 145 f.):\n– Welche Punkte werden im Inhaltsverzeichnis aufgeworfen?\n– Welche Rückschlüsse über Ziele und Methode gestattet die Einleitung?\n– Was sind die inhaltlichen Schwerpunkte?– Welche Schlüsselbegriffe werden hervorgehoben?\n– Welche Ergebnisse stehen am Ende (im Fazit bzw. Schluss)?\nNach Beantwortung dieser Fragen kann der Text bzw. die Informationsquelle dahinge-\nhend eingestuft werden, ob sie hilfreich ist oder nicht. Ist das der Fall, folgt das gründ-\nliche, studierende Lesen (kursorisches bzw. intensives Lesen). Hat das diagonale Lesen aber ergeben, dass der Text nur am Rande mit dem eigenen Thema zusammenhängt, \nwird man sich die nötigen Literaturangaben notieren und eventuell, wenn es der \nZeitrahmen zulässt oder die Entwicklung des Forschungsprojekts es fordert, zu einem späteren Zeitpunkt darauf zurückgreifen.\nNachdem eine Literaturauswahl erfolgt ist, können die wichtigsten Quellen intensiv \nstudiert werden. Nun ist ein genaues, verstehendes Lesen an der Tagesordnung. Dazu gehört,\n– sich mit den Inhalten intensiv auseinanderzusetzen,\n– eigene Fragen zu stellen und die Antworten im Text zu suchen,– das Gelesene mit dem eigenen Wissen und Praxiserfahrungen zu vergleichen,\n– wichtige Stellen wiederholt zu lesen und zu reflektieren,\n– Textstellen zu markieren, um wichtige Inhalte schnell wiederzufinden,– Zusammenhänge zu erkennen und eventuelle Widersprüche aufzudecken.\nDie genannten Punkte bezeichnen den allgemein üblichen Umgang mit wissenschaft-\nlichen Texten. In strukturierter Form soll mit der PQ4R-Methode, die eine spezielle \nLesemethode ist, im Grunde genau das gleiche erzielt werden.\nDie PQ4R-Methode\nDie PQ4R-Methode  gilt als bewährte Lesemethode, die in ihren Grundzügen vorgestellt \nwerden soll. In sechs Schritten soll der Inhalt und die wesentlichen Ergebnisse eines \nkomplexen Textabschnitts (wie z. B. eines Buchkapitels) erschlossen werden.\n1. Preview (Vorschau):  Zu Beginn wird der Text diagonal gelesen. Dabei sollte nicht der \nganze Text, sondern eine Einheit des Textes (ein Kapitel oder Unterkapitel) überflogen \nwerden. Besonders zu achten ist dabei auf die Überschriften, die es ermöglichen, eine grobe Struktur vor Augen zu bekommen.\n2.

1\nåSQL301Ein wörtliches Zitat kann durch Auslassungen wunderbar verfälscht und in seiner Aus-\nsage gerade umgedreht werden. Auslassung bedeutet, dass mehr als ein Wort entweder \nam Anfang oder am Ende oder mitten im wörtlichen Zitat nicht übernommen wird. Die-\nses Auslassen wird durch drei Punkte („…“) gekennzeichnet. Wichtig ist, dass dadurch der Sinn der Aussage nicht entstellt wird.\nB Schauen wir uns ein Beispiel an. Im originalen Text findet sich die folgende Aussage:\n„Die Ergebnisse der Studie konnten die Relevanz der untersuchten Erfolgsfaktoren \nnicht zweifelsfrei belegen.“\nIn der eigenen Arbeit wird nun der Anfang des Satzes leicht umformuliert um dann \neinen Teil der Aussage wörtlich zu zitieren. Das wäre eine Auslassung:\nWissenschaftliche Studien konnten die Bedeutung der untersuchten Einflussgrößen \n„… nicht zweifelsfrei belegen“ .\nEine unzulässige Auslassung wäre:\nWissenschaftliche Studien konnten die Auffassung der Praxis hinsichtlich der relevan-\nten Einflussgrößen „… zweifelsfrei belegen“ .\nDa beim wörtlichen Zitat die Gedanken des Autors nicht abgeändert werden dürfen, \nmüssen auch Schreibfehler oder veraltete Schreibweisen übernommen werden genauso \nwie nicht mehr zeitgemäße Formulierungen. Auf veraltete Schreibweisen oder auf Schreibfehler darf jedoch hingewiesen werden, damit deutlich wird, dass es sich um \nkeine eigenen Fehler handelt. Dieser Hinweis erfolgt durch die Ergänzung (sic!) in \nKlammern direkt nach dem Fehler. Dieser Begriff stammt aus der lateinischen Sprache und steht für „sic erat scriptum“, d. h. „so stand es geschrieben“. \nB Beispiel:\n„Gegenstand von Business-to-Business-Geschäften sind Investitionsgüter bzw. –\ndienstleistungen, die in Organizationen (sic!) eingesetzt werden.“\nNicht nur Rechtschreibfehler müssen beim wörtlichen Zitat übernommen werden, son-\ndern auch sämtliche Hervorhebungen, wie z.

1\nåSQL301Der Lesefluss wird durch solche Zusätze nicht unbedingt verbessert. Daher werden sol-\nche Anmerkungen meistens vermieden, indem man die Hervorhebungen übernimmt.\nIn Zeiten der Globalisierung kommt es ja auch hin und wieder vor, dass Inhalte aus \nfremdsprachigen Publikationen oder Webseiten übernommen werden. Was ist dabei zu \nbeachten? Wird eine Aussage aus einem fremdsprachigen Text wörtlich übernommen, dann wird sie, wie bei allen wörtlichen Zitaten, in Anführungszeichen gesetzt und mit Quellenangaben belegt. Per Fußnotentext, nach der Quellenangabe, wird jedoch eine \nÜbersetzung mitgeliefert. Eine einzige Ausnahme gibt es jedoch: die englische Sprache \nwird mittlerweile als bekannt vorausgesetzt. Zitate aus englischsprachigen Publikatio-nen werden also genauso behandelt wie Zitate in deutscher Sprache. Das bedeutet, dass \neine Übersetzung eines wörtlichen englischen Zitats nicht erforderlich ist.\nBei der Übersetzung von fremdsprachigen Zitaten ist wiederum darauf zu achten, dass \nder Sinn der Aussage nicht verzerrt oder verfremdet wird. Der genaue Wortlaut sollte so präzise wie möglich übernommen werden. Zudem sollten fremdsprachige Zitate eher \nsparsam eingesetzt werden.\nDieser Umgang mit einem fremdsprachigen Zitat wird analog verwendet, wenn Sie eine \nwissenschaftliche Arbeit in englischer Sprache verfassen. In diesem Fall wären Zitate in deutscher Sprache als ausländischer Text einzuordnen. Auch dazu sollte dann eine \nÜbersetzung in der Fußnote mitgeliefert werden. Nur wenn Sie davon ausgehen können, \ndass die Leser Ihrer Studie der deutschen Sprache mächtig sind, dann kann die Über-setzung entfallen. \nWiederholt ist nun schon der Begriff „Quellenangabe“ gefallen. Damit ist der Fundort \neines Zitats gemeint, also das verwendete Buch oder die recherchierte Internetseite. \nSolche Fundorte müssen präzise angegeben werden. Zu diesem Zweck haben die Wis-senschaftler im Lauf der Jahre die sogenannten Zitiersysteme entwickelt.\n1.3.1.3\nVollbeleg und Kurzbeleg\nDie Zitiersysteme unterscheiden sich teilweise im Detail leicht zwischen den verschie-\ndenen Hochschulen und den verschiedenen Fachbereichen. So genügt beispielsweise in \ntechnischen Disziplinen oft die Angabe des Titels einer Publikation, während im sozial- und wirtschaftswissenschaftlichen Bereich exakte Seitenangaben gefordert werden. \nDennoch ist man sich über die grundsätzlichen Formen einig. \nVollbeleg  bedeutet, dass alle bibliografischen Angaben zu einer Quelle und die genaue \nSeitenzahl, also der Fundort, angegeben werden. Die Quellenangaben beim Zitat selbst entsprechen in diesem Fall den Angaben (bis auf die Seitenzahl) im Literaturverzeich-\nnis. Damit stehen dem Leser sofort alle bibliografischen Daten beim Zitat zur Verfü-\ngung. Der Nachteil dieses Ansatzes ist es, dass die kompletten Angaben oft relativ viel Platz benötigen und die Arbeit durch stark aufblähen. In Dissertationen können solche \nAngaben samt weiterer Anmerkungen teilweise über die Hälfte einer Seite ausmachen. \nDadurch wirkt so eine Doktorarbeit sehr unübersichtlich\nBeim Kurzbeleg  werden nur ein paar knappe Angaben zum zitierten Werk beim Zitat \nselbst gemacht. Die vollständigen bibliografischen Angaben werden erst im Literatur-\nverzeichnis aufgelistet. Damit wirkt eine Studie schlanker und übersichtlicher.

\nText in einem Klammerausdruck angegeben und zwar nur als Kurzbeleg. Bei der deut-\nschen Zitierweise, die auch als Chicago-Style bezeichnet wird, werden nach den Zitaten Fußnotenzeichen gesetzt, um die Quellen dann im Fußnotentext anzugeben. Die Quel-len können dann entweder als Vollbeleg oder als Kurzbeleg aufgeführt werden.\nDie Unterschiede zwischen diesen verschiedenen Formen möchte ich Ihnen an einem \nBeispiel verdeutlichen.\nB In einer wissenschaftlichen Arbeit, in diesem Fall in einem Assignment, findet sich fol-\ngende Aussage:\n „Doch zu Beginn eines jeden Forschungsprojekts steht die Forschungsplanung. Sie \nbildet das Fundament der Forschung und ist gleichzeitig die erste von drei Phasen des Forschungsprozesses. Sie wird auch Modellphase oder Designphase genannt und \nebnet den Weg zur empirischen Phase. Hier wird das Forschungsziel definiert und das \nForschungsproblem präzisiert. In diesem St atus wird der Ablaufplan festgelegt und \ndie angewendeten Methoden erläutert.“\nWie sieht nun die korrekte Quellenangabe für dieses Zitat aus? Das kommt darauf an, \nwelche Variante gewählt worden ist.

1\nåSQL301Welche Angaben werden nun aber verlangt bei einer Internetquelle oder bei einem Auf-\nsatz aus einem Sammelwerk? Diese verschiedenen Varianten betrachten wir uns im \nnächsten Abschnitt.\nK[40] Was könnte man als zentralen Nachteil des Kurzbelegs verstehen?\nK[32] Welche der folgenden Aussagen sind korrekt? Kreuzen Sie die richtigen Antworten an:\n„Bei wörtlichen Zitaten dürfen …\na) … die Gedanken des Autors inhaltlich nicht abgeändert werden.“\nb) … die Schriftart und Schriftgröße des originalen Zitats nicht verändert werden.“c) … inhaltliche Ausführungen mit dem Hinweis (sic!) aktualisiert werden.“\nd) … der Lesefluss verbessert werden durch eine moderne Formulierung von veralteten \nRedewendungen.“Für wissenschaftliche Arbeiten gelten besondere Regeln bezüglich der Darstellung, wie z. B. Fußnoten, Zitate und Verzeichnisse. Die Einhaltung der formalen Vorga-ben wirkt sich auf die Bewertung der Arbeit aus. Eine wichtige Rolle spielt dabei die \nZitierweise, also die Gestaltung der Quellenangaben. Grundsätzlich gilt: Ausführun-\ngen ohne Quellenangaben stammen vom Autoren!\nBeim direkten oder wörtlichen Zitat werden fremde Ideen wortwörtlich übernom-\nmen. Es wird durch Anführungszeichen am Anfang und am Ende markiert.\nBeim indirekten Zitat werden fremde Gedanken in eigenen Worten wiedergegeben. \nDies wird durch ein „vgl.“ bei der Quellenangabe deutlich gemacht.\n„Vergessene“ Quellenangaben kommen einem Diebstahl geistigen Eigentums \ngleich. Ebenso handelt es sich bei Shake & Paste, Halbsatzflickerei, Übersetzungen \nohne Quellenangaben oder anderen Formen um Plagiate, also um eine unrecht-\nmäßige Übernahme fremder Gedanken.\nVeränderungen in einem wörtlichen Zitat sind grundsätzlich nicht zulässig, aber \nmöglich, wenn sie eindeutig gekennzeichnet werden, wie z. B.:\n– Auslassungen: nur Teile der Aussage werden wörtlich übernommen;\n– Hinweise auf Schreibfehler durch „(sic!)“;\n– Anmerkungen, um veränderte Hervorhebungen zu verdeutlichen.\nBei fremdsprachigen direkten Zitaten ist eine Übersetzung anzugeben. Die englische \nSprache wird jedoch als bekannt vorausgesetzt.\nBei den Quellenangaben werden bestimmte Informationen in einer festgelegten Rei-\nhenfolge verlangt. Grundsätzlich können diese Quellenangaben im laufenden Text \n(angloamerikanische Zitierweise) oder in Form von Fußnoten (deutsche Zitierweise) vorgenommen werden.

______________.“\n1.3.2\nAnforderungen an Quellenangaben\nIm Rahmen der Literaturrecherche lassen sich verschiedenste Arten von Unterlagen für \ndie eigene Arbeit finden. Das Spektrum reicht von Forschungsarbeiten an Hochschul-\neinrichtungen über Fachbücher, Nachschlagewerke, Sammelwerke, Fachzeitschriften \nbis hin zu Gesetzestexten, Internetquellen, Weblogs, E-Books, Filmen bzw. Videos und firmeninternen Unterlagen. Die Quellenangabe für diese Vielfalt an Arten lässt sich \nnicht auf eine einzige Vorgabe reduzieren. Es gilt jedoch der Grundsatz der eindeutigen \nNachvollziehbarkeit. Die Quellenangabe ist also stets so zu gestalten, dass der Fundort eines Zitats eindeutig identifiziert werden kann. Bei den Anforderungen im Detail \nunterscheiden wir nach den wichtigsten Arten an Quellen.\n1.3.2.1\nZitierweise von Monografien und Sammelwerken\nDie größte Rolle als Quelle spielen nach wie vor Fachbücher, Monografien und Lehr-\nbücher. Damit sind gedruckte Publikationen gemeint, die von einem Autoren geschrie-ben worden sind. Es können auch mehrere Autoren an einem Fachbuch beteiligt sein, \ndoch sind dann die individuellen Beiträge nicht erkennbar. Ansonsten handelt es sich \num ein Sammelwerk. Haben Sie also ein Fachbuch in Ihrer Studie verwendet, dann sind als Vollbeleg bzw. im Literaturverzeichnis folgende Angaben erforderlich:\nPFamilienname des Autors und seine Vornamen. Die Vornamen können auch abge-\nkürzt werden, sofern sie in ausgeschriebener Form nicht gefunden werden können.\nPFamilienname und (abgekürzte) Vornamen der Koautoren, sofern welche vorhanden \nsind.\nPVollständiger Titel des Werks samt dem Titel der Schriftenreihe, sofern vorhanden, \noder ergänzender Untertitel.\nPVerwendete Auflage mit allen Ergänzungen, wie z. B. „12. leicht überarbeitete Auf-\nlage“. Die erste Auflage wird nicht angegeben. Bei Publikationen ohne Angabe einer \nAuflage handelt es sich automatisch um die erste.\nPErscheinungsort bzw. Erscheinungsorte. Es sind alle Erscheinungsorte aufzuführen. \nIst kein Erscheinungsort erkennbar, dann wird mit der Angabe „o. O.“ (= ohne Ort) \nverdeutlicht, dass der Ort nicht einfach vergessen worden ist.\nPErscheinungsjahr. Ist kein Erscheinungsjahr erkennbar, dann wir die Abkürzung \n„o.

1\nåSQL301lässig. Die Zitierweise muss jedoch über die ganze Arbeit hinweg einheitlich gestaltet \nwerden.\nB Ihnen liegt ein Standardwerk im Marketing von Jochen Becker vor. Das Buch wird also \nim Vollbeleg bzw. im Literaturverzeichnis folgendermaßen aufgeführt:\n„Becker, Jochen: Marketingkonzeption – Grundlagen des zielstrategischen und ope-\nrativen Marketing-Managements, 9. aktualisierte und ergänzte Auflage, München \n2009.“\noder:\n„Becker, Jochen (2009): Marketingkonzeption – Grundlagen des zielstrategischen \nund operativen Marketing-Managements, 9. aktualisierte und ergänzte Auflage, \nMünchen.“\nHaben mehrere Autoren gemeinsam ein Buch verfasst, ohne dass die Beiträge im Buch \neinzelnen Autoren zugerechnet werden können, dann sieht die Quellenangabe genauso \naus:\n„Meffert, H./Burmann, Ch./Kirchgeorg, M.: Marketing – Grundlagen marktorien-\ntierter Unternehmensführung – Konzepte – Instrumente – Praxisbeispiele, 11. über-arbeitete und erweiterte Auflage, Wiesbaden 2012.“\nbzw.\n„Meffert, H./Burmann, Ch./Kirchgeorg, M. (2012): Marketing – Grundlagen markt-\norientierter Unternehmensführung – Konzepte – Instrumente – Praxisbeispiele, 11. überarbeitete und erweiterte Auflage, Wiesbaden.“\nNun gibt es auch Sammelwerke oder Festschriften , – die sogenannten unselbstständigen \nSchriften –, in denen mehrere Autoren mitgewirkt haben, indem sie einen Abschnitt \noder einen Aufsatz im Buch geschrieben haben. Das sieht man daran, dass im Inhalts-\nverzeichnis oder zu Beginn des Aufsatzes der Autor ausdrücklich aufgeführt wird. In diesem Fall sind folgende Angaben erforderlich:\n– Familienname, ausgeschriebener Vorname oder abgekürzter Vorname:\n– vollständiger Titel des Aufsatzes oder des Beitrags oder Kapitels,\n– das Wort „in:“ – Familienname und Vorname des Herausgebers plus „(Hrsg.)“,\n– vollständiger Titel des Sammelwerks,\n– Auflage mit allen Ergänzungen, wenn es sich nicht um die erste handelt,– Erscheinungsort oder „o.

1\nåSQL301B In einem Sammelwerk zur modernen Markenführung hat J. L. Aaker einen Artikel \ngeschrieben, aus dem Sie für Ihr Assignment Inhalte verwendet haben. Diese Quelle ist \ndann anzugeben mit:\n„Aaker, Jennifer L.: Dimensionen der Markenpersönlichkeit, hrsg. von Esch, Franz-\nRudolf: Moderne Markenführung – Grundlagen – Innovative Ansätze – Praktische \nUmsetzungen, 4. vollständig überarbeitete und erweiterte Auflage, Wiesbaden 2005, \nS. 165–176.“\noder als Alternative:\n„Aaker, Jennifer L. (2005): Dimensionen der Markenpersönlichkeit, in: Esch, Franz-\nRudolf (Hrsg.): Moderne Markenführung – Grundlagen – Innovative Ansätze – Prak-\ntische Umsetzungen, 4. vollständig überarbeitete und erweiterte Auflage, Wiesbaden, S. 165–176.“.\nEbenfalls häufig zum Einsatz kommen Artikel aus Fachzeitschriften . Für solche Artikel \ngenügt eine pauschale Angabe wie „Schmalenbachs Zeitschrift für betriebswirtschaft-\nliche Forschung“ oder „Chip“ oder „Open Automation“ bei Weitem nicht. Auch für \neine derartige Quelle sind genaue Angaben zu machen und zwar:\n– Familienname und Vorname des Autors,\n– vollständiger Titel des Artikels,\n– das Wort „in:“\n– vollständiger Name der Zeitschrift oder Zeitung,– Jahrgang, Nummer und/oder Datum der verwendeten Ausgabe,\n– Seiten-/Spaltenangabe von der ersten Seite des relevanten Artikels bis zur letzten.\nB Für Ihr Assignment zur historischen Entwicklung der Betriebswirtschaftslehre finden \nSie in der Zeitschrift Harvard Business Manager einen interessanten Beitrag. Er ist im \nVollbeleg folgendermaßen anzugeben:\n„Domke, Britta; Hegele-Raih, Cornelia und Kuhn, Lothar: Klub der Vordenker – \nKöpfe: Mit welchen Ideen die Professoren das Management nachhaltig geprägt haben, \nin: Harvard Businessmanager – Das Wissen der Besten – Erweiterte Ausgabe der Harvard Business Review, Jubiläumsausgabe 100 Jahre Harvard Business School, \nApril 2008, S. 26–31.“\nOder:\n„Ahlert, D./Schröder, H.: Erlebnisorientie rung im stationären Einzelhandel, in: Mar-\nketing ZFP, 12. Jahrgang 1996, Nr. 4, S. 221–229.“\nWenn Sie einen Fachartikel ohne Autoren  verwenden, dann ist das kein wirkliches \nProblem. Häufig werden interessante Studien von Organisationen, wie z. B. dem Arbeit-\ngeberverband oder von einem Ministerium oder einer Beratungsgesellschaft heraus-\ngegeben. Diese Herausgeber sind nicht identisch mit dem Autor. Ein Autor kann genau genommen nur eine natürliche Person sein.

Welchen Anforderungen muss wohl eine zitierwürdige Quelle \ngrundsätzlich genügen? Kreuzen Sie die richtigen Antworten an.\n„Die verwendete Quelle muss …a) … selbst ausführliche und präzise Quellenangaben enthalten, ü\nb) … durch eine wissenschaftliche Argumentation bei den Sachverhalten \ngekennzeichnet sein, ü\nc) … durch eine korrekte Zitierweise eine Nachvollziehbarkeit der Ausführungen \ngewährleisten, ü\nd) … von einem renommierten Verlag veröffentlicht worden sein. üIn eine wissenschaftliche Arbeit können Informationen aus verschiedensten Quellen \neinfließen. Jede Quelle ist stets so anzugeben, dass sie eindeutig wiedergefunden \nwerden kann.

1\nåSQL301Im Bereich des Internets gibt es nicht „die“ Internetquelle, sondern verschiedene For-\nmen. Wir müssen also etwas genauer hinsehen, welche Quellen jeweils verwendet wor-\nden sind. Einen erster Einstieg in ein Themengebiet stellen oft Zitate aus Online-Lexika \ndar. Die Plattform „Wikipedia“ sollte ja vermieden werden, aber aus „Gablers Wirt-schaftslexikon“ oder einem „Lexikon der Nachha ltigkeit“ wird häufig  zitiert. In diesen \nLexika sind die Autoren zu Stichworten sehr häufig angegeben. Oder Sie haben einen \nFachartikel zu diesem Thema recherchiert. Auch in diesem Fall kann ein Autor angege-\nben werden. Damit lassen sich also drei verschiedene Grundformen für die Quellen im Internet unterscheiden:\nPInternetquellen, für die ein Autor identifiziert oder ein Herausgeber erkennbar ist und \nfür die ein präziser Titel vorliegt: Dann kann, wie bei einer gedruckten Monografie, \nangegeben werden: Nachname des Autors, Vorname: Titel, URL (Datum des Zu-griffs). Bei einem Sammelwerk, wie beispielsweise einem Online-Lexikon, würden \nentsprechend der gedruckten Variante folgende Angaben gefordert werden: Nach-\nname des Autors, Vorname: Titel, Herausgeber, URL (Datum des Zugriffs).\nPInternetquellen, für die weder ein Autor noch ein Herausgeber identifiziert werden \nkann, doch für die ein Titel zu identifizieren ist. Auch in diesem Fall kann die Zitier-\nweise aus dem Bereich der gedruckten Quellen adaptiert werden. Folgende Angaben \nsind erforderlich: o. V.: Titel, URL (Datum des Zugriffs) oder Name der Organisa-tion (Hrsg.): Titel, URL (Datum des Zugriffs).\nPInternetquellen, für die weder Autor oder ein Herausgeber erkennbar ist, noch ein \nTitel recherchiert werden kann. In diesem Fall bleibt nur die Angabe der „nackten“ \nURL, also: URL (Datum des Zugriffs).\nB Im Gablers Wirtschaftslexikon haben Sie ein paar passende Informationen gefunden zum Thema Greenwashing. Unter diesem Stic hwort ist auch der Autor des Stichworts \nvorgestellt worden. Sie können also die Quelle angeben mit:\n„Lin-Hi, Nick: Greenwashing, in: Gabler Wirtschaftslexikon, http://wirtschaftslexikon.\ngabler.de/Definition/greenwashing.html (Zugriff am 6.3.2017)“.\nAuch einen Zeitschriftenartikel, den Sie im Internet gefunden haben, sollten Sie analog \nzum gedruckten Artikel angeben, wie z.

1\nåSQL301„Bundeszentrale für politische Bildung (Hrsg.): Die Wahlen zum Europäischen Parla-\nment, http://www.bpb.de/lernen/themen-im- unterricht/europaei sche-union (Zugriff \nam 6.3.2017).“\nTypische Beispiele für den dritten Fall sind Homepages von Unternehmen oder Organi-\nsationen. Derartige Quellen werden dann intensiv genutzt, wenn Sie beispielsweise \nuntersuchen, wie Unternehmen mit Online-Bewerbungen umgehen oder mit ihrer eige-\nnen Geschichte. Dann finden sich eben Angaben wie z. B.:\n„www.baumev.de (Zugriff am 6.3.2017)“\noder\n„https://www.siemens.de/jobs/jobs_bewer bung/tipps/Seiten/ho me.aspx (Zugriff \n6.3.2017).\nDie verwendeten Webseiten sind so präzise wie möglich anzugeben. Teilweise sieht es \nnicht schön aus, wenn sich eine URL über drei Zeilen erstreckt, aber die Vorgabe ist \neindeutig: so präzise wie möglich! Diese Forderung gibt sich aus dem Prinzip der Nach-\nprüfbarkeit, das für jede wissenschaftliche Arbeit gelten soll.\nDas Prinzip der Nachprüfbarkeit gilt auch für andere digitale Medien , wie z. B. E-Books, \nHörbücher, Videos oder Filme aus Mediatheken. Derartige Quellen können durchaus \nverwendet werden, wenn sie den Anforderungen der Wissenschaftlichkeit genügen. Bei \nder Gestaltung der Quellenangaben werden wiederum die aus dem gedruckten Bereich bekannten Grundgedanken übertragen. So sind im Detail bei den verschiedenen Medien \nnachfolgende Angaben erforderlich.\nBei einem E-Book handelt es sich um ein elektronisches Buch, das mit einem Smart-\nphone, einem Tablet-PC oder mit einem E-Book-Reader gelesen und betrachtet werden kann. Dabei kann es sich um die rein digitale Form eines gedruckten Werks handeln \noder um multimedial erweiterte Darstellungen. So können beispielsweise kurze Filme \noder Links in das Internet in ein E-Book integriert werden. Man spricht dann von Enhanced oder Enriched E-Books. Sie werden häufig im PDF-Format oder im EPUB-\nFormat vertrieben. E-Books vom Internetshop Amazon sind allerdings in der Regel nur \nim Kindle-Format erhältlich (vgl. Bendel, o. J, Internetquelle).\nBei den E-Books unterscheiden sich die Vorgaben bezüglich der geforderten Angaben \nnoch stark zwischen den Hochschulen. Handelt es sich bei einem E-Book um eine digi-\ntalisierte Form eines Fachbuchs, dann ist gegen eine Verwendung einer solchen Quelle \nin einer wissenschaftlichen Arbeit nichts einzuwenden. In diesem Fall sind folgende Informationen erforderlich: Nachname des Au tors, Vorname (ggf. abgekürzt): Titel mit \nZusatz (E-Book: Fabrikat des E-Book-Readers), Auflage, Erscheinungsort, Erschei-\nnungsjahr, verwendeter Abschnitt oder Kapitel. Die bekanntesten E-Book-Reader, Tolino und Kindle, zeigen die Inhalte unterschiedlich an. Deshalb kann eine präzise \nSeitenangabe nicht verlangt werden.

1\nåSQL301Autorenname und -vorname, Titel sowie URL und Datum des Downloads zitiert wer-\nden.\nB Über den Internetshop Amazon haben Sie das E-Book zum wissenschaftlichen Arbeiten \nerworben und verwenden Inhalte daraus in Ihrer wissenschaftlichen Arbeit. Diese \nQuelle würden Sie im Literaturverzeichnis folgendermaßen angeben.\n„Theisen, Manuel R.: Wissenschaftliches Arbeiten: Erfolgreich bei Bachelor- \nund Masterarbeit (E-Book: Kindle-Edition), 16. vollständig überarbeitete Auflage, \nMünchen 2013.“\nEine neue Form des Lesens sind darüber hinaus die Hörbücher . Seit etwa zehn Jahren \nsteigt der Bekanntheitsgrad dieser Gattung rasch an. Trotzdem gibt es keine einheitliche Definition dafür, was Hörbücher sind. Sie denken jetzt sicherlich an gesprochene Text, \ndie aus dem Internet heruntergeladen werden können, oder bestenfalls noch an CDs, auf \ndenen vorgelesene Romane gespeichert worden sind. Aber was ist mit Hörspielen, Pod-casts oder O-Ton-Collagen? \nDer größte Verlag für Hörbücher ist der Hörverlag in München. Er subsumiert unter \ndem Begriff „Hörbücher“ (vgl. Buecher-Wiki, o. J., Internetquelle):\nPdie klassische Lesung: Hier wird ein Fachbuch oder ein Roman in gekürzter oder \nungekürzter Fassung von einem oder von mehreren Sprechern vorgelesen. Diese \nLesung kann mit Geräuschen oder Musik unterlegt werden. \nPdas Hörspiel: dabei wird ein Buch zu einem eigenständigen Skript umgeschrieben. \nDas Buch dient also nur als Vorlage. Ein solches Hörspiel wird meistens mit ver-\nschiedenen Sprechern besetzt, professionell inszeniert und mit Geräuschen und Musik unterlegt.\nPdas Feature: ein Sachthema wird unterhaltsam mit Erzählern, Interviewpartnern und \nsogenannten O-Tönen aufbereitet. Es wird meist von Rundfunkanstalten produziert \nund kann dann über eine Mediathek abgerufen werden. \nPbei der O-Ton-Collage werden Originaltöne, z. B. aus Gesprächen mit Passanten, \nzusammengeschnitten. Als Grundlage gibt es weder ein Buch noch ein Skript.\nVor allem die beiden Hörbuch-Gattungen zeigten in den letzten Jahren beeindruckende \nWachstumsraten auf. Allerdings ist ein Hörspiel nach wie vor relativ teuer in der Pro-\nduktion, während bei einer Lesung vor allem ein bekannter Sprecher wichtig ist.\nDie Angaben, die zu den einzelnen Gattungen beim Download oder auf den CDs von \nden Herstellern mitgeliefert werden, unterscheiden sich noch stark.

1\nåSQL301B Für Ihr Assignment haben Sie ein Hörbuch auf vier CDs erworben. Aufgrund der Infor-\nmationen auf dem Cover geben Sie die Quelle wie folgt an:\nKreuter, Dirk (Autor); Kreuter, Dirk et al.1 (Sprecher): Neukunden mit System (Hör-\nbuch), o. O., 2009, CD 2, 00:58:30 bis 01:13:28.\nEin Beitrag, den Sie in der Mediathek eines Radiosenders gefunden haben, wäre dann \nanzugeben mit:\nWarum der Vorsitzende des Technologiekonzerns zurückgetreten ist (2015), Sen-\ndung: Fazit, Deutschlandradio Kultur, Sendezeit: 16. Januar 2015, 23:37 Uhr, 06:05 Minuten, online abrufbar unter: http://ondemand-mp3.dradio.de/file/dradio/2015/01/\n16/drk_20150116_2337_5051e0e7.mp3, (Zugriff: 17.1.2017).\nDas Internet bietet mittlerweile auch einen breiten Zugriff auf Filme und Videos . So \nfinden sich auf der Internetplattform Youtube beispielsweise Aufzeichnungen von Vor-\nträgen von Experten zu einer Vielzahl von Technik-, Informatik- und Marketingthemen. Fernsehsender erlauben einen Zugriff auf Mediatheken mit fundiert recherchierten Bei-\nträgen. Bei der Verwendung von solchen Informationen in wissenschaftlichen Arbeiten \nwird unterschieden zwischen eher kurzen Videoclips und längeren Filmen. Dementspre-chend sind folgende Informationen erforderlich:\nVideoclip: Name des Autors oder des Regisseurs oder Username: Titel des Clips, \nexakte URL (Zugriffsdatum). Verwendete Sequenz in 00:00:00.\nFilm: Titel (Jahr), ggf. Autoren, Produzenten oder Regisseure, Produktionsort/-land \n(Länderkürzel), Produktionsjahr, Spieldauer. \nB Aus einem Videobeitrag auf der Plattform Youtube haben Sie ein Clusterdiagramm zur Wissenschaftstheorie von Sir Karl Popper übernommen. Die korrekte Quellenangabe \nwäre also:\nOppitz, Marcus (User): Karl Popper – Wissenschaftstheorie, https://www.you-\ntube.com/watch?v=gIXFRnLp_Do&t=207s (Zugriffsdatum: 10.3.2017), 00:03:32.\n1  Das Kürzel „et al.“ ist lateinischen Ursprungs. Es entspricht der deutschen Abkürzung „u. a.“. Aller-\ndings wird es vor allem im Literaturverzeichnis von wissenschaftlichen Arbeiten eingesetzt. Wenn mehr \nals drei Autoren aufgeführt werden müssten, dann kann diese Auflistung abgekürzt werden mit der \nAngabe des ersten Autors und dem Zusatz „et al.“.Neben den gedruckten Quellen werden in wissenschaftlichen Arbeiten immer häufi-\nger auch digitale Quellen eingesetzt. Die Vorgaben für die Quellenangaben werden \nentsprechend übertragen. Allerdings gibt es nicht die einheitliche „digitale“ Quelle, \nsondern eine wachsende Zahl von Varianten. Das Prinzip der Nachprüfbarkeit gilt jedoch auch für die Angaben zu den digitalen Medien.\nDie üblichen Internetquellen lassen sich danach unterscheiden, ob ein Autor oder ein \nTitel für den Beitrag identifiziert werden können.

1\nåSQL301K[43] Warum ist die Verwendung von Informationen aus der Internetplattform Wikipedia in \nwissenschaftlichen Arbeiten verpönt?\nK[34] Bei Ihren Recherchen zum Thema Wertschöpfungskette stoßen Sie auf der Internetseite \ndes Gabler Wirtschaftslexikon auf eine Grafik, die zwischen Primär- und Sekundärakti-\nvitäten unterscheidet. Als Quelle dieser Abbildung ist „Porter“ angegeben. Sie möchten die Abbildung in Ihre Arbeit übernehmen. Ein Autor ist für den Artikel nicht aufgeführt. \nWie geben Sie diese Quelle im Literaturverzeichnis an?\nK[23] Dürfen Informationen aus einem Podcast, der von einem großen Konzern betrieben \nwird, in eine wissenschaftliche Arbeit übernommen werden?\nK[29] Eine Studentin der AKAD University stellt Ihnen folgende Frage:\n„Für meine jetzige Hausarbeit zum Kompensationsmodell von Kehr habe ich mir auf \nYoutube ein Video mit einem seiner Vorträge angeschaut und teilweise Dinge über-\nnommen. Kann ich den Link zum Video einfach als Quelle angeben oder wie müsste \nman das machen (oder überhaupt)?“\nWas antworten Sie ihr?ständigen Titel des Beitrags samt der URL und dem Zugriffsdatum zitiert. Bei Sam-\nmelwerken ist zudem der Herausgeber aufzuführen.\nBei E-Books handelt es sich meistens um eine digitalisierte Form eines Fachbuchs. \nIn diesem Fall sollten dieselben Angaben wie für ein Fachbuch erfolgen. Der Titel wird lediglich ergänzt um die Angabe: (E-Book: Fabrikat des Readers).\nUnter dem Begriff „Hörbücher“ werden klassische Lesungen von Fachbüchern, aber \nauch Hörspiele, Features und O-Ton-Collagen subsumiert. Die von den Produzenten \nangegebenen Daten unterscheiden sich aber noch sehr stark, sodass eine einheitliche Zitierweise kaum möglich ist. Ideal ist es, folgende Informationen als Quellenan-\ngabe aufzuführen: Familienname des Autors, Vorname, Name und Vorname des \nSprechers, vollständiger Titel mit Zusatz (Hörbuch), Erscheinungsort und Erschei-nungsjahr sowie die verwendete Sequenz anstelle der Seitenangaben.\nBei Filmen und Videos wird unterschieden zwischen eher kurzen Videoclips und \neher längeren Filmen. Je nach Genre werden unterschiedliche Angaben verlangt:\nVideoclip: Name des Autors oder des Regisseurs oder Username: Titel des Clips, \nexakte URL (Zugriffsdatum).

1\nåSQL3011.3.2.3\nZitierweise bei sonstigen Quellen\nNeben diesen digitalen Medien ist es im praktischen Teil einer Studie oft erforderlich, \nauf Unterlagen von Unternehmen  zuzugreifen. Gerade wenn konkrete Problemlösungen \nfür ein Unternehmen erarbeitet werden sollen, ist es unumgänglich, das Unternehmen \nvorzustellen und den Ist-Zustand zu erfassen. Dafür sind Quellen erforderlich, die nicht \nöffentlich zugänglich sind und keiner Kategorie präzise zugeordnet werden können, wie z. B. Geschäftsberichte, Prozessbeschreibungen, Qualitätsmanagement-Handbücher, \ninterne Rundschreiben, Auswertungen aus dem SAP-System, Informationen aus dem \nIntranet, Protokolle zu Teamsitzungen usw.\nFür solche Quellen gilt der Grundsatz: sie müssen wiedergefunden werden können, da-\nmit Ihre Ausführungen in der wissenschaftlichen Arbeit nachprüfbar bleiben. Eine be-\nstimmte Reihenfolge oder Art der Angaben kann in diesem Fall aufgrund der Fülle an \nVarianten nicht vorgegeben werden. Sinnvoll ist es, derartige Quellen mit „Interne Un-terlagen Firma Sowieso“ zu kennzeichnen und in einem separaten Verzeichnis aufzu-\nführen. \nIn kleineren Unternehmen sind interne Informationen manchmal nur in den Köpfen der \nFührungskräfte gespeichert. In solchen Fällen müssen diese Daten durch ein persön-liches Gespräch oder ein Interview gewonnen werden. Ein persönliches Gespräch ist \neher unstrukturiert. Trotzdem sollten Sie Informationen aus einem solchen Gespräch \nbelegen, wenn sie in einer wissenschaftlichen Arbeit verwendet werden. Fertigen Sie zu diesem Zweck ein Gedächtnisprotokoll an. Es sollte das Datum des Gesprächs, den \nNamen und die Funktionsbezeichnung des Gesprächspartners enthalten, Ihren Namen \nals Protokollant sowie stichpunktartig oder in Halbsätzen die wesentlichen Inhalte. Sie können dann als Quelle angeben „Gedächtnisprotokoll zum Gespräch mit Herrn/Frau \nSowieso (Funktionsbezeichnung) vom Datum“.\nAndere Anforderungen werden an ein Interview gestellt. Wenn Sie interne oder externe \nExperten interviewen oder Kunden, egal ob  face-to-face oder telefonisch, dann sollten \nSie nach Möglichkeit das Gespräch aufzeichnen und anschließend transkribieren, also \nabschreiben. Für eine systematische qualitative Auswertung von Interviews genügen \nStichworte nicht. Vielmehr sind die verwendeten Worte und Redewendungen wichtig. Die transkribierten Interviews werden im Anhang der Arbeit beigelegt.\nDiese Übersicht möchte ich abschließen mi t einigen Hinweisen zu Sonderformen, wie \nz. B. Formeln, Gesetze, Verordnungen und dergleichen.\nAuch mathematische, statistische oder technische Formeln und Gleichungen  sind \nnatürlich mit Quellenangaben zu belegen. Solche Formeln oder Gleichungen werden zitationstechnisch wie Text behandelt. Also kommen die Regeln für gedruckte Mono-\ngrafien, Fachzeitschriften oder Internetquellen entsprechend zum Zuge.\nWenn \nGesetze  einfach im Text angesprochen werden, dann sollten sie ausgeschrieben \nwerden, wie z. B. „Bürgerliches Gesetzbuch“. Werden konkrete Paragrafen aus einem Gesetz zitiert, z. B. um einen Begriff zu definieren, dann genügt die Angabe des Nor-\nmenwerks und des präzisen Paragrafen.

1\nåSQL301B Für eine Definition des Begriffs „Kaufmann“ geben Sie in einer wissenschaftlichen \nArbeit an:\n„Ein Kaufmann im Sinne des Handelsgesetzbuches (HGB) ist, wer ein Handels-\ngewerbe betreibt.“ Die korrekte Quellenangabe ist: HGB, §1, Abs. 1.\nBei der Verwendung eines Gesetzestextes wird unterstellt, dass Sie sich auf die aktuelle \nAusgabe beziehen. Frühere Ausgaben von Gesetzen, die zum Zeitpunkt der Erstellung Ihrer Arbeit nicht mehr gültig sind, müssen explizit als solche gekennzeichnet werden. \nDazu gibt man an: „in der Fassung vom“ bzw. „i. d. F. v.).\nGenauso wie Gesetzestexte werden Normenwerke behandelt, wie z. B. die Deutsche \nIndustrie Norm (DIN), die Regelwerke der International Organization for Standardisa-tion (ISO) oder Europäische Normen (EN). Auch in diesem Fall genügt die präzise \nAngabe der relevanten Norm ohne weitere Zusätze, wie z. B. DIN EN ISO 9001, SA \n8000, OHSAS 18001 usw.\n1.3.2.4\nAngaben im Kurzbeleg\nDie umfassenden bibliografischen Angaben, die wir jetzt zu gedruckten Publikationen, \ndigitalen Medien und sonstigen Unterlagen besprochen haben, sind erforderlich im \nLiteraturverzeichnis und wenn die Quellenangaben als Vollbeleg gestaltet werden. In \nder wissenschaftlichen Praxis ist bei der Gestaltung der Quellenangaben jedoch mehr und mehr der sogenannte Kurzbeleg zu finden. Auch für wissenschaftliche Arbeiten an \nder AKAD University ist die Quellenangabe pe r Kurzbeleg zulässig. In diesem Fall sind \nfür eine Quellenangabe folgende Daten erforderlich:\n– Familienname des Autors bzw. der Autoren bzw. „o. V.“ bzw. die herausgebende \nOrganisation;\n– Erscheinungsjahr oder alternativ dazu ein Kurztitel;\n– Fundort des Zitats d. h. Seite/-n, die verwendet worden ist/sind, bzw. Angabe „Inter-\nnetquelle“.\nIm Literaturverzeichnis werden dann alle weiteren Angaben zu der verwendeten Quelle \nnachgereicht. Dabei muss gewährleistet werden, dass eine Zuordnung des Kurzbelegs \nzu der ausführlichen Quellenangabe im Literaturverzeichnis eindeutig und zweifelsfrei möglich ist. Nicht passieren darf es also, dass ein Kurzbeleg wie z. B. „o. V., 2017, \nInternetquelle“ zwei oder mehr Quellenangaben im Literaturverzeichnis zugeordnet \nwerden könnte. Um Missverständnisse zu vermeiden, werden üblicherweise:\n– die verwendeten Kurztitel in der ausführlichen Quellenangabe hervorgehoben durch \nUnterstreichen oder Fettdruck;\n– der verwendete Kurztitel – sofern der ge wählte Begriff im Titel der ausführlichen \nQuellenangabe nicht vorhanden ist – als Klammerausdruck zum Titel im Literatur-verzeichnis dazugeschrieben;\n– Jahreszahlen mit Kleinbuchstaben (z.

1\nåSQL301und Erscheinungsjahr zu gestalten, dann sollten alle Kurzbelege mit einem Erschei-\nnungsjahr oder der Angabe „o. J.“ versehen werden. Kurztitel dürfen dann in der Arbeit \nnicht eingesetzt werden. Vor allem bei Internetquellen ist es teilweise schwierig, ein \nErscheinungsjahr zu identifizieren, denn das Erscheinungsjahr ist nicht deckungsgleich mit dem Jahr, in dem Sie auf die Website zu greifen. Genauso sollte die Gestaltung mit \nKurztitel einheitlich über alle Kurzbelege hinweg verwendet werden.\nIn der Fachliteratur werden die Angaben teilweise durch Kommata voneinander \ngetrennt, teilweise durch einen Klammerausdruck, d. h.:\n– Nachname, Erscheinungsjahr, Seitenangabe bzw.\n– Nachname (Erscheinungsjahr), Seitenangabe\nBeide Gestaltungsvarianten sind an der AKAD University zulässig, müssen aber wiede-\nrum konsequent angewendet werden.\nBei der Entwicklung von konkreten Lösungen für ein Unternehmen müssen im prak-tischen Teil einer wissenschaftlichen Arbeit häufig unternehmensinterne Quellen herangezogen werden, wie z. B. Geschäftsberichte oder Auswertungen aus DV-Sys-\ntemen, Excel-Tabellen usw. Auch diese Quellen müssen angegeben werden und \nzwar so, dass sie wiedergefunden werden können. Eine bestimmte Reihenfolge oder Art der Angaben kann aufgrund der Verschiedenartigkeit der möglichen Dokumente \nnicht gefordert werden.\nZudem sind Informationen, die aus Gesprächen mit Kollegen, Vorgesetzten oder \nKunden gewonnen werden mit Quellenangaben zu belegen. Dafür genügt ein Gedächtnisprotokoll.\nEine systematische qualitative Auswertung von Gesprächen ist nur möglich, wenn \ndie Interviews transkribiert worden sind. Diese Aufzeichnungen sind samt der Aus-\nwertung im Anhang einer Arbeit beizulegen.\nFormeln und Gleichungen werden wie Text mit Quellenangaben belegt.Gesetze, Verordnungen oder Normen werden so genau wie möglich angegeben, \njedoch ohne weitere bibliografische Angaben.\nBeim Kurzbeleg werden in der Quellenangabe nur wenige Daten angegeben. Die \nüblichen bibliografischen Daten zu einer Quelle werden erst im Literaturverzeichnis \naufgeführt. Als Angaben für einen Kurzbeleg sind erforderlich:\n– Familienname des Autors bzw. der Autoren bzw. „o.

1\nåSQL3011.3.3\nAbbildungen und Tabellen\nViele Prozesse, Kausalverbindungen und Datenerhebungen und was sonst noch thema-\ntisiert werden kann, lassen sich gut veranschaulichen durch den Einsatz von Abbildun-gen und Tabellen. Der Umgang damit will allerdings auch gelernt sein. Hierzu im Fol-\ngenden einige Tipps und Hinweise. Dabei werden zunächst einige formelle Aspekte \nangesprochen, um darauf einige Denkanstöße zu geben, wann überhaupt Abbildungen und Tabellen sinnvoll sind.\n1.3.3.1\nFormale Gestaltung von Abbildungen und Tabellen\nNummerierung Tabellen und Abbildungen sind mit einer gesonderten und fortlaufenden Nummerierung zu versehen. Hinter der Nummerierung sollte eine sprechende Überschrift angefügt \nwerden.\nAbbildung 5: Beispiel für Schriftsprache in Bezug auf Quantität und Sinn (Komplexität)\nAbbildungs-/Tabellentitel \n(Überschrift)Die eigenständige Überschrift sollte den Inhalt der Abbildung oder der Tabelle so genau \nwie möglich treffen. Grundsätzlich sollte jede Überschrift unterhalb der Abbildung \nbzw. Tabelle stehen.\nÜberflüssige (redundante) Informationen sollten vermieden werden, die Überschrift im \nKopfbereich der Grafik beispielsweise. Diese Überschrift ist deshalb überflüssig, da grundsätzlich eine Abbildungsbezeichnung vorzu nehmen ist. Sie ist als Titel der Abbil-\ndung aufzufassen, die somit keines zusätzlichen Titels bedarf. Auf unser Beispiel über-\ntragen hieße das, dass „Schriftsprache in Bezug auf Quantität und Sinn (Komplexität)“ zusätzlich innerhalb der Abbildung auftauchen würde.

1\nåSQL301Nennen. Auf den nachfolgenden Seiten ist der Hinweis „(Fortsetzung)“ dem Titel hin-\nzuzufügen. Tabellen, die auf mehreren Seiten dargestellt werden, müssen auf jeder Seite \ndie vollständige Spaltenüberschrift vorweisen.\nJede Abbildung oder Tabelle sollte selbständlich vollständig sein, d. h. alle relevanten \nInformationen und Bezeichnungen enthalten und ggf. über eine Legende verfügen. Je-\ndoch sollte eine Abbildung oder Tabelle nicht für sich alleine sprechen müssen. Viel-\nmehr sollten die wesentlichen Aussagen einer Abbildung oder Tabelle im Text der Ar-beit wiederholt werden, so dass diese gestalterischen Elemente in den Text eingebunden \nsind.\nWie auch die im Beispiel angeführte Abbildung sollten sämtliche Abbildungen die volle \nTextbreite haben und gerahmt werden. Das macht den äußeren Eindruck ansprechend und stellt zwischen den Abbildungen eine Einheitlichkeit her. Außerdem wird dem Be-\ntrachter dadurch die Fokussierung erleichtert. Zudem wirkt es ansprechender wenn eine \nAbbildung oder Tabelle von Text umrahmt wird. Eher unvollständig wirkt eine Position einer Abbildung unmittelbar nach einer Überschrift oder ganz am Ende von Ausfüh-\nrungen.\nEinheitlichkeit Ein weiterer Punkt in Sachen Optik: Sie sollten alle Abbildungen einheitlich gestalten. Dies können Sie erreichen, indem Sie die Abbildungen selbst gestalten und darauf ach-\nten, dass die Resultate wie „aus einem Guss“ erscheinen. Wenn Sie die Grafiken bei-spielsweise mit PowerPoint erstellen, fügen Sie Grafiken bitte immer auf die gleiche \nWeise ein. Zusätzlich sollte darauf geachtet werden, dass alle Grafiken mit einem \nimmer gleichbleibenden Maßstab verkleinert oder vergrößert werden, damit alle Grafi-ken die gleiche Strichstärke aufweisen.\nEine sich immer mehr ausbreitende Unkultur ist das Scannen von Grafiken aus Lehr-\nbüchern oder Ähnlichem. Zwei Dinge sprechen gegen dieses Vorgehen. Zum einen ver-\nletzen gescannte und verwendete Grafiken leicht auch dann Urheberrechte, wenn die Quelle genannt wird. Zum anderen ist die Qualität gescannter Dokumente meist ver-\ngleichsweise schlecht und häufig sind einzelne Schriftzüge nicht oder nur schlecht zu \nlesen. Es ist deshalb anzuraten, geeignete Grafiken selber nachzubauen und sie dadurch auch dem Stil der Arbeit anzupassen.\nAbbildungs-/\nTabellenverzeichnisAlle Abbildungen und Tabellen müssen in einem eigenen Verzeichnis eingetragen wer-\nden. Ein derartiges Abbildungs- oder Tabe llenverzeichnis kann erstellt werden, wenn in \nIhrer Arbeit ein oder zwei Abbildungen bzw. Tabellen vorkommen.

1\nåSQL301Zitation Für Abbildungen und ggf. auch Tabellen gilt das, was für Zitate gilt: Die Quellen müs-\nsen angegeben werden. Es bietet sich an, das ebenfalls in den Fußnoten zu tun, wobei die Fußnotenziffer am besten hinter den Titel angebracht wird. Im Fußnotenapparat \nwird dann die nötige Quellenangabe gemacht, deren Hinweis in Abhängigkeit zum \nGrad der Anlehnung bzw. Übernahme und der Eigenleistung steht und danach gewählt werden muss. Dabei wählen Sie aus folgenden Möglichkeiten aus:\nTabelle 4:\nKennzeichnungen\nvon Grafiken\n1.3.3.2\nZum Einsatz von Abbildungen und Tabellen\nBilder, Grafiken, Tabellen, Strukturbilder, Diagramme, Fotos und Screenshots – sprich: \nalle Arten von Visualisierungen – sollten an richtiger und nicht willkürlicher Stelle ein-\ngesetzt werden, d. h. also da, wo der Sachverhalt es erfordert. Es gibt hier keine strikte Regel und ein gewisser Spielraum liegt immer im Ermessen des Verfassers. Daher sol-\nlen hier nur einige Denkanstöße in Form von Fragen formuliert werden, die Sie sich \nselbst stellen sollten, ehe Sie von veranschaulichenden Elementen Gebrauch machen.\nStellen Sie sich die Frage, ob die von Ihnen vorgenommenen Visualisierungen\n– das Geschriebene verdeutlichen, etwa besonders komplexe und schwierige Inhalte \nleichter zugänglich machen.\n– dem Leser eine bedeutende Verständnishilfe geben.– das Behalten erleichtern.\n– Bestandteile, Abhängigkeiten und Zusammenhänge genau so aufzeigen, wie sie im \nText dargestellt werden.\n– eine geeignete Darstellungsform sind (Diagrammtyp, Bildaufbau usw.).\n– „schlank“ sind, d. h. ausschließlich Relevantes darstellen und wenig bzw. keine deko-\nrativen Elemente aufweisen (die willkürlich sind, da der Sachverhalt sie nicht unbe-dingt erfordert).\nAutoren wissenschaftlicher Arbeiten sollten mit Visualisierungen sparsam verfahren, \nschließlich ist es nicht das Ziel, ein Bilder buch zu erstellen, sondern einen Text zu \nschreiben, dessen Hauptbestandteil die Sprache bzw. der Text ist. Nicht jeder Sachver-\nhalt erfordert es, visualisiert zu werden.„vergleiche“ Eine Vorlage wird abgezeichnet und inhaltlich nicht modifiziert.\n„in Anlehnung an“ Die Abbildung basiert auf der eigenen konzeptionellen Leistung des \nAutors. Sie ist eigens hergestellt und modifiziert. Als Grundlage hat sie \ndie Arbeitsergebnisse eines anderen/mehrerer anderer.

1\nåSQL301K[13] Zählen Sie auf, was formell beim Gebrauch von Tabellen und Abbildungen zu beachten \nist.\nK[24] Nennen Sie die präzisen Hinweise der Quellenangaben, die bei Abbildungen (und ggf. Tabellen) gemacht werden müssen bzw. können.\n1.3.4\nGrundlagen zum wissenschaftlichen Schreibstil\nSo wichtig es ist, richtig zitieren und abbilden zu können, der Hauptteil des Schreibens \neiner wissenschaftlichen Arbeit besteht nich t aus Zitaten und Abbildungen, sondern aus \nText. Dieser ist das am meisten gebrauchte Darstellungsmittel einer wissenschaftlichen \nArbeit. Damit ist der Schreibstil  sehr wichtig und man sollte seine Gestaltung nicht dem \nZufall überlassen.\nEs gibt keine klaren Regeln dazu, wie man schreiben soll. Allerdings ist es ein Irrtum zu \nglauben, dass es reicht, seine Muttersprache nach Orthografie und Interpunktion hin zu \nbeherrschen. Es gibt sehr plausible Ratschläge, die im Rahmen des Erstellens einer Arbeit beachtet werden sollten.\nStil ist nichts Oberflächliches oder Dekoratives. Sie werden sehen, dass die im Folgen-\nden aufgeführten Regeln zur sogenannten Funktionalstilistik  die „äußeren“ sprachlichen \nMittel mit ganz bestimmten inhaltlichen Zwecken versehen. Bevor wir uns dem WIE \nzuwenden, sollten wir das WARUM betrachten.Es gibt eine Reihe von Formkriterien , die beim Gebrauch von Abbildungen und \nTabellen einzuhalten sind. Sie sollten mit einer fortlaufenden Nummerierung ver-sehen werden und einem Untertitel aufgeführt werden. Diese Angaben sollten dann \nauch in einem Abbildungsverzeichnis aufgeführt werden. Quellenangaben sind auch \nhier, wie bei Zitaten, präzise zu leisten.\nAbbildungen sind einheitlich zu gestalten. Es sollten keine redundanten, aber die \nwesentlichen Informationen (z. B. Legenden und Überschriften) vorkommen, wodurch Abbildung und Tabelle sich von selbst erklären und vom Text unabhängig \nsind.\nVisualisierungen müssen gezielt eingesetzt  werden. Nicht jeder Sachverhalt bietet \nsich für eine Visualisierung an.

1\nåSQL3011.3.4.1\nGründe für eine Funktionalstilistik\nWarum sollten Sie sich um einen klaren und leicht verständlichen Ausdruck bemü-\nhen? Warum stilistische Fragen ernst nehmen und an Ihrem Stil arbeiten? Zur Beant-wortung dieser Frage ist es hilfreich, sich folgende drei Perspektiven vor Augen zu \nführen: Berufsperspektive, Schreiberperspektive und Leserperspektive (vgl. Franck \n2009, S. 125f.).\nBerufsperspektive Hinsichtlich der Berufsperspektive ist zu sagen, dass in vielen Berufen verlangt wird, \npräzise und verständlich schreiben zu können. Damit hängt das Erlernen eines derarti-\ngen Schreibstils ggf. eng mit dem Erlernen des Berufes zusammen.\nSchreiberperspektive Als Verfasser einer wissenschaftlichen Arbeit haben Studierende es mit den Herausfor-derungen des Schreibens zu tun. Einen eigenen Text zu verfassen fällt den meisten hier-bei nicht leicht, schon gar nicht, wenn er präzise, sachgetreu und gut verständlich sein \nsoll. Wer einen einfachen und klaren Stil wählt, erleichtert sich selbst das Schreiben .\nLeserperspektive Auch der Leser ist dankbar, wenn er nicht lange „herumrätseln“ muss, was ihm nun \neigentlich mitgeteilt werden soll. Aus ökonomischer Perspektive könnte man sagen, \ndass ein komplizierter Schreibstil die Kosten des Verstehens eines Textes erhöht. Folg-\nlich senkt ein präziser und direkter Schreibstil die Kosten der Leser und sollte schon deshalb das Ziel eines jeden Ökonomen sein.\nIm Folgenden werden einige Merkmale des wissenschaftlichen Schreibstils genannt. \nDiese sollen als Orientierungshilfe beim Verfassen wissenschaftlicher Texte dienen.\n1.3.4.2\nFormulieren für wissenschaftliche Texte\nDie Aussagen in einer wissenschaftlichen Arbeit sollen präzise, nachvollziehbar und \nüberprüfbar sein. Diese Anforderungen spiegeln sich auch im Schreibstil wider.

1\nåSQL301Missverständnissen führen kann. Folgende Anforderungen an den Stil sollten vielmehr \nberücksichtigt werden:\nPObjektivität , d. h. ein Sachverhalt wird ohne subjektive Wertung des Autors erörtert. \nZu diesem Zweck werden die Mittel einer unpersönlichen Ausdrucksweise einge-\nsetzt, wie z. B. Sätze mit einem sachlichen Subjekt. Personalpronomen wie „ich“ oder „mein“, aber auch „wir“ oder „unser“ sind zu vermeiden. Wenn trotzdem die subjektive Einstellung oder Einschätzung des Autors zum Ausdruck gebracht werden \nsoll, dann geschieht dies mit der Formulierung „… nach Meinung des Autors“ oder \n„… der Verfasserin“.\nPModalität:  der Bestimmungsgrad der Aussage sollte angesprochen werden. Wenn ein \nBegriff beispielsweise in der Fachliteratur nicht eindeutig definiert ist oder eine Vor-\ngehensweise im Unternehmen als „problematisch“ angesehen wird, dann sollte dies \nthematisiert werden. Hin und wieder werden zudem die Ergebnisse von eigenen empirischen Untersuchungen interpretiert, die jedoch auf einer nicht repräsentativen \nStichprobe basieren. In solchen Fällen ist mit Formulierungen wie „es ist anzuneh-\nmen“ oder „kann man mit Einschränkungen sagen“ usw. zu arbeiten.\nPFolgerichtigkeit:  wird durch sprachliche Mittel zum Ausdruck gebracht, die Bedeu-\ntungsträger für Kausalität und Finalität sind. Die Aussagen sollen ja nachvollziehbar \nsein. Deshalb ist zu argumentieren und zu begründen, nicht einfach zu entscheiden. \nTypische Formulierungen sind also: „weil“ oder „sodass“ bzw. „aus diesem Grunde“ usw.\nPKlarheit:  wird erzielt durch den Einsatz von klar definierten Fachausdrücken und \ndurch die Vermeidung von umgangssprachlichen Redewendungen. Eine Formulie-\nrung wie beispielsweise „über den Tisch ziehen“ oder „im Nebel herumstochern“ ist zwar sehr bildlich, aber unsachlich. Dazu gehört auch die Klärung von zentralen Be-\ngriffen, indem verschiedene Definitionen diskutiert werden. Darüber hinaus ist es \nhilfreich, wenn sehr viele Fachbegriffe eingesetzt werden müssen, wie z. B. im Be-reich der Informatik oder im Banksektor, ein Glossar aufzubauen.\nPDichte:  Informationen werden in wissenschaftlichen Arbeiten komprimiert und kom-\npakt vorgestellt. Das ist aber nur möglich, wenn der „rote Faden“ in der Argumenta-\ntion konsequent durchgehalten wird. Dekorative Redewendungen, weitschweifige Formulierungen, umständliche Erklärungen oder Füllwörter werden als redundant \nbetrachtet. Allerdings kommt es unter diesem  Aspekt oft zu komplizierten, in sich \ngestaffelten Satzstrukturen mit vielen Substantiven.\nEin Text in einer wissenschaftlichen Arbeit wird nicht besser, wenn er kaum zu verste-\nhen ist. Berücksichtigen Sie also auf der anderen Seite auch praktische Grundsätze wie:\nPEin Gedanke, ein Satz! Kurze Sätze mit ca. neun bis zwölf Wörtern sind meist ver-\nständlicher und aussagefähiger als lange Sätze. Sie zwingen jedoch dazu, die Aus-\nsagen klar zu strukturieren.\nPFremdwörter nicht um ihrer selbst willen verwenden. Für die präzise Formulierung \neines Sachverhalts sind Fachbegriffe unentbehrlich. Dabei handelt es sich oft um \nFremdwörter, für die es keine Entsprechung in der deutschen Sprache gibt, wie z. B. \n„Marketingkonzept“. Daneben existieren aber auch viele Fremdwörter, die im Ver-gleich zu den adäquaten deutschen Begriffen keine höhere Präzision bringen.

1\nåSQL301PAktive Sprache: die Forderung nach Objektivität und Dichte führt häufig zu passiven \nSatzkonstruktionen. In Verbindung mit vielen Substantiven wirkt der Stil dann rasch \n„trocken“ und „unverständlich“. Trotz dieser Forderungen sollte bewusst darauf ge-\nachtet werden, aktive Formulierungen zu verwenden. Eine Aussage wie „wer fragt, der führt“ erzeugt immer noch eine höhere Aufmerksamkeit wie „der Gefragte wird geführt vom Frager“.\nPPhrasen vermeiden: Redewendungen ohne präzise Inhalte oder nichtssagende Redens-\narten haben in wissenschaftlichen Arbeiten nichts zu suchen. \nTrotz der besonderen Anforderungen an den Stil in einer wissenschaftlichen Arbeit setzt \nsich mehr und mehr ein Trend durch, der weg von langen Sätzen und weg vom Nomi-nalstil führt. Wissenschaftlich formulieren heißt somit wieder – kurz gesagt –, die \nInhalte auf das Wesentliche beschränken, treffende Begriffe zu verwenden und auf jede \nForm von Worthülsen zu verzichten (vgl. Balzer et al., 2008, S. 240).\nK[45] Mit welchen Stilmitteln kann die Genauigkeit von Aussagen unterstrichen werden? \nK[47] In einem Assigment zur Rolle von Lesestrategien findet sich folgende Passage:\n„Lesestrategien unterstützen beim Lernen z. B. durch Aufzeigen von Zeitfressern, \nÜbungen zur Konzentrationssteigerung sowie Schaffen einer angenehmen Atmo-\nsphäre. Im Laufe der Zeit entwickelt man seinen eigenen Lerncharakter, den man \nimmer weiter ausbauen kann. Meine persönliche Lesemethode ist die PQ4R-Methode. Ich setze sie hauptsächlich für Fächer ein, die auf den ersten Blick besonders schwer \nerscheinen oder in denen ich kaum Vorkenntnisse habe. Im ersten Augenblick erkennt \nman keine großartige Verbesserung. Wenn man aber zu einem Thema befragt wird, das mit dieser Methode gelernt wurde, erinne rt man sich oftmals an die beispielsweise \nbunte Gestaltung der Arbeitsblätter, die zerpflückten Thematiken oder die Grafiken \nund Skizzen, mit denen man sich bei diesem Thema beschäftigt hat, und kommt so zu einem positiven Ergebnis.“\nWelche Anforderungen an den Stil einer wissenschaftlichen Arbeit werden in dieser \nPassage nicht berücksichtigt?Der Schreibstil in einer wissenschaftlichen Arbeit unterscheidet sich von einem per-\nsönlichen Brief oder einem Artikel in der Bild-Zeitung. Die Ausführungen sollen \npräzise, nachvollziehbar und überprüfbar sein.

2\nåSQL3012\nWissenschaftliche Hauptarbeit\nAlles, was Sie in der „wissenschaftlichen Vorarbeit“ gelernt haben, können und sollten \nSie dort anwenden, wo Sie selbst wissenschaftlich tätig werden. Sobald Sie selbst in \nAktion treten und eigene Resultate erzielen, beginnt die „eigentliche“ wissenschaftliche \nHauptarbeit. Wie hat das konkret auszusehen? Dieser Frage wollen wir uns im vorlie-genden Kapitel zuwenden.\n2.1\nErscheinungsformen von wissenschaftlichen Arbeiten\nIm Rahmen eines Hochschulstudiums bzw. der weiteren Qualifizierung gibt es folgende \nwissenschaftliche Arbeiten:\n– Seminararbeiten (oft in Form einer elektronischen Präsentation);– Projektberichte;\n– Studienabschlussarbeiten (Bachelor- oder Ma sterthesis; Diplomarbeit; Magisterarbeit);\n– Dissertationen;– Habilitationen.\nDarüber hinaus können im Rahmen des Wissenschaftsbetriebs und der Forschung einer \nHochschule noch Formen auftreten wie:\n– Dokumentationen wissenschaftlicher Forschung und Arbeit;\n– Veröffentlichungen von Forschungsergebnissen von Forschungsberichten sowie wis-\nsenschaftliche Artikel in Fachzeitschriften.\nAlle diese verschiedenen Arten von wissenschaftlichen Arbeiten folgen im Großen und \nGanzen einer bestimmten Struktur. Um die Frage: „Wie baue ich meine wissenschaftli-\nche Arbeit auf?“ geht es in den folgenden Abschnitten.\n2.2\nWissenschaftliche Arbeiten bei der AKAD University\nAn die unterschiedlichen Formen von wissenschaftlichen Arbeiten, die an einer Hoch-\nschule unterschieden werden, stellen die Universitäten teilweise unterschiedliche An-forderungen. Bei der AKAD University werd en vor allem folgende drei Arten unter-\nschieden:\nAssignments Bei den sogenannten Assignments  handelt es sich um kleinere wissenschaftliche Arbei-\nten mit ca. acht bis zwölf Seiten im Umfang. Sie werden in der Regel als Prüfungsleis-tung in einem Modul erbracht. Die Themen für diese Assignments werden von Dozen-\nten der Hochschule für die relevanten Module vorgegeben.

2\nåSQL301Projektbericht Mit dem sogenannten Projektbericht  werden die Ansprüche bereits höher. Er umfasst \nca. 25 bis 30 Seiten und dient dazu, ein Projekt oder eine konkrete Problemlösung in einem Unternehmen kritisch zu reflektieren bzw. eine Problemlösung zu erarbeiten. \nTeilweise werden auch kleine, eigenständige empirische Untersuchungen durchgeführt, \nwie z. B. bei einem Titel wie „History Marketing – Untersuchung der Rolle der Unter-nehmensgeschichte in der Werbung von Luftfahrtgesellschaften“ Die typischen The-\nmen für diese Art von wissenschaftlichen Arbeiten, die sich keinem speziellen Modul \nmehr zuordnen lassen, sind bei der AKAD Un iversity jedoch eher unternehmensbezo-\ngener Art, wie z. B.: „Konzept zur Optimierung eines Geschäftsprozesses am Beispiel \ndes Einstellungsprozesses eines deutschen Flughafens“ oder “Entwicklung eines Kon-\nzepts für einen Imagefilm für eine oralchirurgische Praxis.“ Durch solche Themen ist es möglich, eigene Ideen und Gedanken in die Studie einfließen zu lassen, auch wenn der \ngrößere Teil der Ausführungen noch deskriptiver Art sein darf.\nBachelorthesis, Diplom-\narbeit oder MasterthesisDer krönende Abschluss des Studiums ist es, im Rahmen des Bachelor-, Diplom- oder \nMasterstudiums eine anspruchsvolle, eigenständige Abschlussarbeit zu erarbeiten. Mit \neiner derartigen Bachelorthesis, Diplomarbeit oder Masterthesis  zeigt man als Student, \ndass man nun in der Lage ist, Konzepte, Modelle und Zusammenhänge aus dem Stu-\ndium korrekt wissenschaftlich aufzubereiten, zu bewerten und ggf. anhand eines Fall-\nbeispiels konkret umzusetzen. Je nach Studienart unterscheiden sich jedoch die Anfor-derungen bei der AKAD University. Eine B achelorarbeit umfasst üblicherweise ca. 45 \nbis 60 Seiten, eine Diplomarbeit 45 bis 70 Seiten und eine Masterarbeit darf auch mal \n80 Seiten erreichen. Für eine gute Note ist jedoch nicht die Seitenzahl ausschlaggebend, sondern die erbrachte Eigenleistung.

2\nåSQL301PMasterarbeiten:\n– Konzeptionierung und Modellierung von modularen Versorgungskanälen einer vari-\nantenreichen Produktion\n– Entwicklung einer Business-Intelligence(BI)-Governance für ein mittelständisches \nVersicherungsunternehmen\n– Concepts for Service Level Differentiation  in CRM-Processes using Business Rules \nManagement\nStudienabschlussarbeiten an der AKAD University können problemlos auch in engli-\nscher Sprache verfasst werden.\n2.3\nRahmenbedingungen für wissenschaftliche Arbeiten an der AKAD University\nBevor mit einer wissenschaftlichen Arbeit wie Projektbericht oder Abschlussarbeit be-\ngonnen werden kann, muss ein geeignetes Thema gefunden sowie ein erster Gliede-\nrungsvorschlag skizziert werden. Die ersten  Titel- und Gliederungsvorschläge dienen \nder Suche und der Abstimmung mit dem zukünftigen Betreuer. Der Betreuer muss ein haupt- oder nebenamtliches Mitglied des Lehrkörpers der AKAD University sein. Jeder \nStudent kann sich „seinen“ Betreuer auswählen. Bei der Kontaktaufnahme mit dem ge-\nwünschten Betreuer ist es geschickt, den Titel- und Gliederungsvorschlag gleich mitlie-fern zu können. Damit kann sich der Betreuer ein konkretes Bild von den anvisierten \nInhalten machen.\nBei der Wahl eines Themas kann man sich als Student von Beispielen, Konzepten und \nMethoden anregen lassen, die während des Studiums diskutiert worden sind. Gerade berufstätige Studenten stellen während des Studiums regelmäßig Verbesserungspoten-\nziale im eigenen Unternehmen fest, sei es im Projektmanagement, im Wissensmanage-\nment, bei der Entwicklung neuer Produkte, oder stoßen auf Themenbereiche, die den privaten Interessen entgegenkommen, wie z. B. Rolle von Betriebskindergärten, Chan-\ncen von Bewerbungen per Internet, Nachhaltigkeitsmanagement in Zoos usw.\nGenauso können Anstöße für ein Thema der eigenen Abschlussarbeit durch Herausfor-\nderungen im Unternehmen resultieren. Gerade wenn in demjenigen Unternehmen, in dem man beschäftigt ist, konkrete Projekte geplant sind, Umstrukturierungen anstehen, \nneue Produkte auf dem Markt eingeführt, IT-Konzepte realisiert oder eine neue Produk-\ntionslinie aufgebaut werden soll, dann bietet es sich an, diese Vorhaben wissenschaft-lich zu begleiten. Selbstverständlich können auch konkrete Problemlösungen auf wis-\nsenschaftlicher Basis systematisch erarbeitet werden. \nEine dritte Möglichkeit der Ideengenerierung ist es, zu überlegen, welche berufliche \nPosition nach dem Studium angestrebt wird. Diese gewünschte berufliche Weiterent-wicklung kann durch die Wahl eines adäquaten Themas für die Abschlussarbeit geför-\ndert werden.

2\nåSQL301Auf jeden Fall sollte das gewählte Thema attraktiv sein. Jeder Student muss sich meh-\nrere Monate lang mit dem präferierten Themenbereich auseinandersetzen, um eine fun-\ndierte wissenschaftliche Arbeit erstellen zu können. Wenn Sie „Ihr“ Thema als langwei-\nlig ansehen und sich jedes Mal an den Schreibtisch zwingen müssen, dann kann diese Bearbeitung des Themas sehr mühsam werden. Wählen Sie also ein Thema aus, das Sie intellektuell reizt und das etwas Neues für Sie enthält. \nDas Thema für einen Projektbericht oder eine Abschlussarbeit muss aber nicht nur \nIhnen gefallen, sondern auch gewisse Anforderungen aus der Sicht der Wissenschaft \nerfüllen. Im Einzelnen sollten folgende Ansprüche befriedigt werden:\nPGenau dasselbe Thema darf bislang noch in keiner anderen wissenschaftlichen Arbeit \nbearbeitet worden sein. Diese Forderung trifft auf Assignments an der AKAD \nUniversity nicht zu. Aber bei Projektberic hten oder Abschlussarbeiten muss dieser \nGrundsatz beachtet werden. Da man als Student meist keinen Überblick über die ver-fassten Abschlussarbeiten hat, ist es wichtig, mit dem Betreuer zusammen diese \nFrage zu klären.\nPDas Thema einer Abschlussarbeit muss eine konzeptionelle Bearbeitung zulassen. \nDas bedeutet, dass das Thema Raum bieten muss für ein eigenes Konzept oder eine eigene Problemlösung. Aktuelle und komplexe Themenstellungen haben dabei ein \nhöheres Anspruchsniveau als die Bearbeitung grundsätzlich bekannter Themen. Es \nist beispielsweise schon möglich, im Rahmen einer Bachelorarbeit auch für Ihr Unternehmen eine Balanced Scorecard zu entwickeln, doch ist die Vorgehensweise \ngrundsätzlich bekannt und in der Praxis erprobt. Das wäre also ein leichtes Thema. \nDie Möglichkeiten von Wearables, wie z. B. iWatch oder Google Glases, für das Marketing sind noch kaum erforscht. Das wäre also ein anspruchsvolleres Thema. \nRein deskriptive Themen, wie z. B. die Vorstellung der Kennzahlen, die ein Unter-\nnehmen im Controlling einsetzt, lassen keine Eigenleistung zu. Sie kommen für Abschlussarbeiten nicht infrage.\nPDas Thema selbst sollte präzise formuliert werden und Aufschlüsse über den Inhalt \nsowie die eigene konzeptionelle Idee zulassen. Eine Themenstellung wie z. B. „Die \nFührungskraft als Coach“ lässt nicht erkennen, was in dieser Arbeit entwickelt, untersucht oder erarbeitet werden soll. Demgegenüber wäre ein Titel wie „Untersu-\nchung der erforderlichen Kompetenzen für eine coachende Führungskraft“ aussage-\nfähiger und präziser.\nPEin normal langer deutscher Satz mit ca. neun bis 15 Wörtern sollte für den Titel \neiner wissenschaftlichen Arbeit ausreichen.\nPAbkürzungen sollten im Titel einer wissenschaftlichen Arbeit vermieden werden, \nabgesehen von allgemein bekannten Buchstabenkombinationen wie beispielsweise \nAG, EU, DAX, GmbH, USA und dgl. Aber wer kennt schon das EFQM-Modell, QR-Codes, einen OEM oder ein ERP-System? Wenn Sie Zweifel haben, ob eine Abkür-\nzung bekannt ist oder nicht, dann verwenden Sie eher die ausgeschriebene Form!\nMit der Beantragung des Themas beim Prüfungsamt der Hochschule und der Vergabe \nwird aus dem Arbeitsthema der verbindliche Titel für Ihren Projektbericht oder die Abschlussarbeit. Denjenigen Titel, den das Prüfungsamt vergeben hat, dürfen Sie nicht \nmehr verändern.

2\nåSQL301stellt sich die Frage, ob das Unternehmen, für das eine Problemlösung entwickelt wer-\nden soll, im Titel namentlich aufgeführt werden soll oder nicht.\nBei der Klärung dieser Frage sind verschiedene Aspekte zu berücksichtigen:PWenn Sie im Unternehmen arbeiten und das Unternehmen wünscht ausdrücklich, \nnicht namentlich genannt zu werden, dann respektieren Sie bitte diesen Wunsch. Sie \nkönnen anstelle eines konkreten Namens auch einen Fantasienamen verwenden. Bei \nder ersten Nennung des Namens sollten Sie in diesem Fall per Fußnotentext angeben, dass es sich um einen Fantasienamen handelt.\nPBei einer Bewerbung um einen neuen Arbeitsplatz nach Abschluss des Studiums \nwird die Abschlussarbeit oft zu einer Art Visitenkarte. Trägt Ihre Abschlussarbeit \nnun den Namen Ihres früheren Arbeitgebers und noch einen Sperrvermerk, dann dür-fen Sie natürlich die Arbeit nicht im Bewerbungsverfahren vorzeigen. \nPVerlieren Sie aus irgendwelchen Gründen während der Erstellung der Abschlussar-\nbeit Ihren Arbeitsplatz, dann muss der vergebene Titel trotzdem grundsätzlich beibe-\nhalten werden, selbst wenn im Titel Ihr bisheriger Arbeitgeber namentlich aufgeführt ist. Das kann unter Umständen zu Problemen führen.\nAndererseits wirken Titel mit etwas allgemeineren Formulierungen wie z. B. „Entwick-\nlung eines Service-Center-Konzeptes für ein mittelständisches Unternehmen“ anstelle \ndes konkreten Firmennamens etwas unpräziser. Der Name eines renommierten Unter-nehmens im Titel der eigenen Arbeit kann sie zudem aufwerten und eine Bewerbung \nfördern. Besprechen Sie auch diese Frage mit Ihrem Betreuer vor der Vergabe des The-\nmas durch das Prüfungsamt.\nAuch wenn die Themenfindung zur Aufgabenstellung bei der Erstellung eines Projekt-\nberichts oder einer Abschlussarbeit gehört, heißt das nicht, dass Sie mit niemandem dar-\nüber reden dürfen. Sie können durchaus mit einem potenziellen Betreuer Kontakt auf-\nnehmen oder mit der Hochschule, um Informationen einzuholen, ob Ihr angedachtes Thema dem Anspruchsniveau genügt oder auch, welcher Themenbereich untersucht \nwerden könnte.\nB Für einen Studenten der AKAD University stellt sich folgende Herausforderung:\n„In meiner aktuellen Position beim Tiefdru ckunternehmen Sowieso bin ich im Projekt-\nEinführung eines ‚Integrierten Produktions-Management Systems‘ involviert, es han-\ndelt sich hierbei um eine Neuentwicklung, die das heutige Betriebsdatenerfassungs-system ablösen soll. In diesem Rahmen bin ich u. a. verantwortlich für den Bereich \nSchnittstellen und DataWarehouse. Beim Teilprojekt ,Schnittstellen‘ geht es darum, \nden Ist-Zustand darzustellen und/oder die Implementierung im Microsoft BizTalkSer-ver. Das heißt konkret die Beschreibung des aktuellen Aufbaus der Schnittstellen, evtl. \nErweiterungen und die Umsetzung über die Microsoft-Software. Beim Teilprojekt \n,DataWarehouse‘ liegt die Aufgabenstellung darin, zu analysieren, welche Auswer-tungen und Berichte letztlich benötigt werden, wie die Daten von IPMS in ein solches \nDataWarehouse dupliziert werden und welche Tools für die Abfragen bzw.

d. h. einer Dienstleistung fehlt, anders als Sachgütern, die  Stofflichkeit. \nIhre Beurteilung erfolgt hinsichtlich des Nutzens der Dienstleistung. Ein externer Faktor ist \nein Produktionsfaktor, der vom Kunden in den Produktionsprozess eingebracht wird. Er ist \ndamit unabdingbar für die Dienstleistungsproduktion, kann  aber vom Dienstleistungsprozess \nnicht geplant werden. Beispiele für einen externen Faktor sind die Person, ein Objekt, \nInformationen oder Geld.  \n \nAuch das Uno -actu -Prinzip ist ein wesentliches Merkmal, mit dem sich eine Dienstleistung \nvon einer Sachleistun g abgrenzen lässt: Produktion und Konsum fallen zeitlich zusammen. \nDie Dienstleistung ist daher in der Regel nicht konservierbar.  \n \nAus den definierenden Eigenschaften der Dienstleistung resultieren weitere Merkmale und \ndaraus dann besondere Probleme. Und d ie sollen von IT gelöst werden.  \n \nIn Bezug auf die Entwicklung von Dienstleistungen unterscheidet man zwei wesentliche \nBegriffe, „Servicification“ und „Servitization“.  \n \nServitization  ergänzt oder ersetzt Produkte durch Dienstleistungen.  \n \nServicification  richtet das marktliche Handeln auf das Angebot von Dienstleistungen aus.	{"source": "services.pdf", "page": 1}	c8504fa2-9060-11ee-b2b6-5686f88fa7cd	fb564d56-4f33-4c90-ad34-9b9312c6308f

2\nåSQL301Für eine Diplomarbeit käme die Darstellung der Schnittstellen in diesem Unternehmen \nnicht in Betracht. Das wäre eine rein desk riptive Aufgabe. Wenig anspruchsvoll ist es \nauch, zu überprüfen, wie die Schnittstellen mit der Microsoft-Software abgebildet wer-\nden könnten. Der Spielraum für eigene Ideen ist in diesem Fall noch sehr stark einge-schränkt. Demgegenüber eröffnet die Analyse der Anforderungen an ein Data Warehouse samt der Erarbeitung einer konkreten Konzeption sehr viel mehr an Mög-\nlichkeiten, um eigene Ideen in die Arbeit einzubringen.\nK[50] Beurteilen Sie die beiden folgenden Themen für Abschlussarbeiten anhand der Anfor-\nderungen an einen Titel für eine wissenschaftliche Arbeit. Handelt es sich dabei um \n„gute“ Themen?\na) „Das neue Pfandbriefgesetz – Vergleich zwischen alter und neuer Gesetzgebung und \ndie Auswirkungen auf die Bayerische Landesbank“\nb) Der nächste Schritt ins Unternehmerglück – was folgt nach DIN EN ISO 9001? \nEFQM – Selbstbewertung am Beispiel der Daimler Facility Service GmbH\nc) Analyse des Marktumfeldes des globalen Vertriebs der SIEMENS AG und Ableitung \neiner Personalstrategie für alle GeschäftsbereicheAn der AKAD University werden vor allem folgende drei Arten von wissenschaftli-\nchen Arbeiten geschrieben:\nPAssigments  mit ca. acht bis zwölf Seiten, in denen ein vorgegebenes Thema im \nRahmen eines Moduls bearbeitet wird;\nPProjektberichte  mit ca. 25 bis 30 Seiten, in denen ein selbst gewähltes Thema sys-\ntematisch bearbeitet oder eine Problemlösung für ein Unternehmen erarbeitet \nwerden;\nPAbschlussarbeiten , in denen eine anspruchsvolle selbst gewählte Themenstellung \nauf ca. 45 bis 80 Seiten differenziert bearbeitet wird.\nDie Formulierung der Themen für Projektberichte und Abschlussarbeiten sollte mit \ndem gewünschten Betreuer abgestimmt werden.

2\nåSQL3012.4\nAufbau einer wissenschaftlichen Arbeit\nIn einer wissenschaftlichen Arbeit gilt es, komplexe Zusammenhänge so darzustellen, \ndass diese von einem Leser gut nachvollzogen werden können. Ein wesentlicher Bestandteil der Ausarbeitung einer wissenschaftlichen Arbeit ist daher ihre Strukturie-\nrung.\nLeider gibt es für die Strukturierung einer wissenschaftlichen Arbeit kein Patentrezept. \nDer Aufbau ist vielmehr stark abhängig von der Fragestellung und der Zielsetzung der Arbeit. Im Folgenden werden wir versuchen, die wichtigsten Strukturelemente heraus-\nzustellen, anzuordnen und miteinander in Beziehung zu setzen. Damit wird jedoch nicht \nangestrebt, jede denkbare Form von Fragestellung zu berücksichtigen, sondern es wer-den nur die „gängigen“ Untersuchungsformen an Hochschulen berücksichtigt.\nWenn im Folgenden die Rede ist von einem „Konzept“-Kapitel, soll das nicht heißen, es \nkönne nicht auch ein zweites Kapitel dieser Art geben, wenn die Anlage der Arbeit dies \nerfordert. Betrachten Sie den folgenden Aufbau als ein Grundgerüst. Das gleiche gilt für Angaben zu Seitenumfang und zeitlichem Aufwand, den die Bearbeitung eines Kapitels \nin Anspruch nehmen kann. Das sind Richtwerte, die in vielen Fällen sinnvoll sind. \nLetztendlich müssen Sie aber selbst prüfen, ob diese Angaben auch zu Ihrem Vorhaben und Ihrer Fragestellung passen.\n2.4.1\nGliederung und Inhaltsverzeichnis\nDas Inhaltsverzeichnis zeigt die Gliederung einer Arbeit. Dabei sollten Sie sich an den \nAufbau halten, wie er in den kommenden Abschnitten dargestellt wird. Die konkrete \nGliederung Ihrer Arbeit können aber nur Sie selbst entwickeln, da sie von der Problem-stellung abhängig ist.\nIm Verlauf der Arbeit wird sich die Gliederung immer wieder ändern, Punkte kommen \nhinzu oder fallen weg, Umstellungen werden vorgenommen. Das betrifft nicht das \nGrundgerüst, das hier vorgestellt wird, sonder n die konkreten Teile der Gliederung. Das \nwissenschaftliche Arbeiten ist ein Prozess, der aus mehreren unterschiedlichen Arbeits-\nabschnitten besteht. Häufig hängen spätere Abschnitte in Aufbau und Umfang von Er-\ngebnis vorgelagerter Abschnitte ab. Daher kann die Gliederung nicht sofort ins Schwarze \ntreffen, sondern entwickelt sich meist noch fast bis zum Abschluss der Arbeit. \nGleichwohl ist es sinnvoll, gleich zu Beginn der Arbeit eine erste Gliederung zu ent-\nwickeln und zentrale Bausteine der bearbeiteten Thematik stringent anzuordnen. Eine \nderartige Grobgliederung verlangt die AKAD University bei der Prüfung der Vergabe \ndes Themas durch das Prüfungsamt.

2\nåSQL301Abbildung 6:\nBeispiel für einen \nGliederungsentwurf\nAuch wenn diese Gliederung nur wenige Schlagworte beinhaltet, so wird aus ihnen \ndoch bereits der Ansatz deutlich, mit dem das angestrebte Konzept erarbeitet werden soll.\nWenn eine solche grobe Gliederung steht und die ersten Ideen mit dem Betreuer bespro-\nchen worden sind, ist es sinnvoll, die einzelnen Punkte weiter auszudifferenzieren. So \nkann beispielsweise beim Einarbeiten in die Literatur des Fachgebietes das Grundlagen-\nkapitel immer weiter ausdifferenziert werden. Betrachten Sie hierbei die Gliederung als einen dynamischen Teil Ihrer Arbeit. Bis zum Abgabetermin können Sie an der Gliede-rung so viele Änderungen vornehmen wie Sie wollen und eine permanente Optimierung \nvornehmen. Größere Änderungen sollten jedoch mit dem Betreuer abgestimmt werden.\nSelbstverständlich müssen im fertigen Inhaltsverzeichnis sämtliche Überschriften aller \nGliederungsebenen mit Seitenzahlen versehen werden. Zu Beginn der Arbeit können Sie natürlich noch keine exakten Angaben über den Umfang der einzelnen Kapitel und \nUnterkapitel machen. Häufig ist es aber sinnvoll, schon zu Anfang Schätzungen zu \nmachen und sich zu überlegen, wie viele Seiten ein Punkt beanspruchen sollte. Auf \ndiese Weise vermeidet man, dass weniger relevante Punkte übermäßiges Gewicht be-\nkommen, nur weil sich die Literatursuche zu diesem Punkt als sehr leicht herausstellt \nund sich die Seiten schnell füllen.\n1\nAchten Sie darauf, nicht zu tief zu gliedern.

2\nåSQL301Überschrift. Bei einem deutlich längeren Umfang der Ausführungen zu einer Über-\nschrift kommt es gerne zu Redundanzen.\nEine der Funktionen des Inhaltsverzeichnisses ist es, dem Leser eine Orientierungshilfe  \nzu geben und ihn auf das in der Arbeit später ausführlich Behandelte vorzubereiten. Die Formulierung der Überschriften sollten daher so gewählt werden, dass diese möglichst aussagekräftig sind und deutlich. Der Leser kann so entscheiden, ob es für ihn über-\nhaupt relevant ist, und ob die durch den Titel bei ihm geweckten Erwartungen im Ver-\nlauf der Ausführungen überhaupt erfüllt werden. Oder er kann selektiv auf bestimmte Abschnitte eingehen, die für ihn, aus welchen Gründen auch immer, von Belang sind.\nAber auch für den Verfasser der wissenschaftlichen Arbeit ist die Ausarbeitung eines \nInhaltsverzeichnisses ein wertvolles Mittel zur Selbstkontrolle . So eignet sich das \nInhaltsverzeichnis hervorragend dazu, den „roten Faden“  der Arbeit aufzuzeigen und \nnachzuvollziehen. Denn eine der entscheidenden Anforderungen an eine wissenschaft-\nliche Arbeit ist, dass diese einen logischen Aufbau hat und einen eindeutig erkennbaren \ninhaltlichen Zusammenhang vorweist. Das Inhaltsverzeichnis ist also auch für den Ver-fasser ein wichtiges Instrument, mit dessen Hilfe er sich seiner „Storyline“ vergewis-\nsern kann.\nAchten Sie darauf, dass die Überschriften, die im Text stehen, und diejenigen, die im \nInhaltsverzeichnis stehen, identisch sind. Diese Identität kann sehr leicht mit Hilfe von Funktionen in Textverarbeitungsprogrammen  sichergestellt werden, die das Inhalts-\nverzeichnis automatisch aus dem Text und den Formatierungen generieren.\nGenauso sollten „einsame“ Überschriften, wie z. B. ein Gliederungspunkt 4.1 ohne 4.2, \nvermieden werden. Dieser Fehler entsteht, wenn bereits zwischen 4. und 4.1 Erläuterun-gen vorgenommen werden, die jedoch gliederungstechnisch nicht zuzuordnen sind. \nSinnvoll ist es also, zwischen einer Haupt -und einer Unterüberschrift bestenfalls einen \nÜberblick zu geben, aber inhaltliche Erläuterungen zu vermeiden.\nDie Gliederung der Arbeit und mit ihr das Inhaltsverzeichnis ist ein Balanceakt: Sie \nsollte weder zu knapp, noch zu ausführlich sein. Die Schwerpunkte der Arbeit müssen daraus hervorgehen, auch die wesentlichen Aspekte ihrer Bearbeitung. Jedoch ist es \nnicht das Ziel einer Gliederung, alle einzelnen Details wiederzuspiegeln. Denn unnötig \nviele Unterpunkte können den „roten Faden“ der Arbeit zerzausen.\nSollen beispielsweise im Rahmen einer Unternehmensdarstellung die hergestellten Pro-\ndukte dargestellt werden, ist es wenig ratsam, die folgende Gliederung zu wählen:\n2.1 Unternehmensdarstellung\n2.1.1 Angebotene Produkte\n2.1.1.1 Schrauben\n2.1.1.2 Bleche\n2.1.1.3 Rohre\nDiese Form des Textes würde man als „zergliedert“ bezeichnen, da vermutlich auf jeder \nSeite dieses Kapitels mehrere Überschrifte n der vierten Ebene stehen würden.

Wenn dieses Verfahren angewendet wird, stellt sich meist heraus, \ndass nur drei bis vier Gliederungsebenen überhaupt benötigt werden.\nWie sieht nun eine gute Gliederung bzw. ein gutes Inhaltsverzeichnis aus? Der Umfang \ndes Verzeichnisses hängt mit dem Umfang der jeweiligen wissenschaftlichen Arbeit ab. Ein Inhaltsverzeichnis für einen Projektbericht wird also kürzer ausfallen als für eine \nMasterarbeit.\nB Folgendes Beispiel zeigt eine gelungene Gliederung für einen Projektbericht.

2\nåSQL301In diesem Inhaltsverzeichnis finden sich – ganz korrekt – zunächst die geforderten Ver-\nzeichnisse. Das Inhaltsverzeichnis wird im Inhaltsverzeichnis nicht nochmals als Glie-\nderungspunkt aufgeführt. Ein Abkürzungs- und ein Symbolverzeichnis waren in dieser Arbeit nicht erforderlich und konnten somit entfallen. Das Literaturverzeichnis kommt \nam Ende der Arbeit.\nNach der Einleitung mit der Einführung in die Thematik sowie der Definition der Ziele \nwerden in der vorliegenden Studie die erforderlichen Grundlagen erarbeitet. Dieser Aufbau soll dem deduktiven Prinzip entsprechen. Aus dem Titel wird deutlich, dass es \nin der Studie um QR-Codes geht mit der Untersuchung im speziellen Bereich der Zeit-\nschriften. Das Thema „QR-Code“ ist in diesem Fall also allgemeiner als „Zeitschriften“ und muss deshalb zuerst behandelt werden. \nZum QR-Code werden im 2. Kapitel die erforderlichen Grundlagen erarbeitet. Dazu \nwird zuerst der zentrale Begriff „QR-Code“ geklärt. Wie soll man inhaltlich zu Formen \nund Zielen des QR-Codes schreiben, wenn nicht geklärt worden ist, was in der Arbeit darunter verstanden wird? Erst nach der Begriffsklärung und der Einordnung der The-\nmatik in den Kontext des Marketings werden inhaltliche Details zum QR-Code erörtert.\nMit dem 3. Kapitel werden die erforderlichen Grundlagen zum Thema „Zeitschriften“ \ngelegt. Der Theorieteil besteht in dieser Arbeit also aus zwei Kapiteln. Er umfasst insge-samt etwa die Hälfte des Seitenumfangs.\nDer Kern der Themenstellung wird im 4. Kapitel bearbeitet. Hier werden die Einsatzar-\nten untersucht auf der Basis von 30 ausgewählten Zeitschriften. Damit wurde eine \nkleine, eigenständige empirische Erhebung durchgeführt. Der so ermittelte bisherige Einsatz der QR-Codes wird anschließend systematisch bewertet. Veröffentlichungen im \nInternet sowie ein Experteninterview dienen schließlich dazu, die zukünftigen Potenzi-\nale abzuleiten. Verschiedene Methoden wurden somit eingesetzt und eine überdurch-schnittlich hohe Eigenleistung erbracht. \nEine Zusammenfassung samt einer selbstkri tischen Würdigung der Vorgehensweise in \nder eigenen Arbeit sowie ein Ausblick auf die zukünftigen Entwicklungen runden die \nArbeit insgesamt ab. Dieses abschließende Kapitel wird teilweise auch als Fazit bezeichnet oder als Resümee. All diese Bezeichnungen sind zulässig. \nDieselben Elemente sind auch für das Inhaltsverzeichnis einer Bachelor-, Diplom- oder \nMasterarbeit erforderlich. Im folgenden Beispiel sehen Sie das Inhaltsverzeichnis einer \nBachelorarbeit zum Thema „Gamification als Marketinginstrument im stationären Han-del – Untersuchung der Einsatzmöglichkeiten und der Erfolgspotenziale“:Anhang . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

2\nåSQL301B\nAuch in dieser Gliederung umfasst der Grundlagen- oder Theorieteil mehrere Kapitel. \nBei der gewählten Themenstellung war es erforderlich, Grundlagen zu den Themen \nGamification, Marketing und Einzelhandel zu erarbeiten. Durch die drei Themenberei-\nche, die angesprochen werden mussten, ist der Grundlagenteil relativ breit ausgefallen. Den praktischen Teil der Studie bilden das 5. und 6. Kapitel. Hier führt der Autor eine \neigenständige empirische Erhebung durch. Aus den Ergebnissen der Befragung und der \nzuvor durchgeführten Recherche der relevanten Fachliteratur leitet der Verfasser kon-krete Handlungsempfehlungen ab. Damit konnten eigenen Ideen und Gedanken in \neinem überdurchschnittlichen Umfang in die Studie eingebracht werden.Inhaltsverzeichnis Seite\nAbbildungsverzeichnis . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

2\nåSQL301Zur äußeren Form Nun zur äußeren Form des Inhaltsverzeichnisses. Es gibt zum einen das alphanumeri-\nsche, zum anderen das numerische Gliederungssystem.\nBeim alphanumerischen System  wechseln sich Buchstaben und Ziffern bei der Numme-\nrierung der Überschriften ab. Werden die Kapitel auf der ersten Gliederungsebene mit \nGroßbuchstaben markiert (A, B, C …), dann folgen auf der zweiten Gliederungsebene \nZiffern, wie z. B. I, II, III, IV, usw. Auf der dritten Gliederungsebene sind dann wieder Buchstaben zu verwenden, wie z.B. a, b, c usw. und auf der vierten wieder Ziffern, wie \n1., 2., 3., usw. Diese Form der Gliederung findet sich vor allem in Lehrbüchern – bei \nwissenschaftlichen Arbeiten von Studierenden ist sie eher selten.\nIm numerischen System  wird das dekadische System bevorzugt verwendet, in welchem \ndie Kapitel mit einer Zahl (1, 2, 3. u. s. w.), die Hauptabschnitte mit einer Zahlenkombi-\nnation (1.1, 1.2, 1.3 u. s. w.), die Abschnitte mit einer um eine Stelle erweiterten numeri-\nschen Kombination beziffert werden (1.1.1, 1.1.2, 1.1.3 u. s. w.). Auf einen Hauptab-schnitt 1.1 muss auch ein Hauptabschnitt 1.2 folgen, da sonst die Unterteilung keinen \nSinn machen würde.\nIn der Praxis hat sich diese Form der Gliederung als sehr praktikabel erwiesen und wird \nauch von den meisten Studierenden verwendet.\nK[22] Welchen Zweck erfüllt das Inhaltsverzeichnis einer wissenschaftlichen Arbeit für den Leser/für den Verfasser?\nK[4] Welche Arten von Gliederungssystemen gibt es?\n2.4.2\nEinleitung\nDie Einleitung einer Arbeit ist wie der erste Schritt auf einer Wanderung: Mit ihr legt \nman die Richtung fest, in die man gehen will. Immer wieder hört man den Rat, die Ein-\nleitung erst ganz am Ende des Arbeitsprozesses zu schreiben, da man dann den Gang der Untersuchung kennt und sich der Text leichter schreibt. Dies würde aber bedeuten, dass man seiner Arbeit nicht selbst die Richtung gibt, sondern quasi durch das Thema \ntaumelt und erst am Ende weiß, wo man angekommen ist – sicherlich für keinen Wan-\nderer eine befriedigende Vorstellung.\nFür die Einleitung gilt daher dasselbe wie für die Gliederung: Sie muss am Beginn der \nArbeiten entstehen und der Arbeit eine Richtung geben. Denn die Einleitung beinhaltet \nwichtige Punkte wie z. B. Problemstellung und Zielsystem, die der Verfasser der Arbeit Das Inhaltsverzeichnis (Gliederung) gibt die inhaltlichen Schwerpunkte einer Arbeit \nin ihrer Abfolge zu erkennen. Damit zeigt es den „roten Faden“ der Arbeit auf, der \nein typisches (und unerlässliches) Merkmal einer wissenschaftlichen Arbeit ist.

2\nåSQL301unbedingt schon zu Anfang klar vor Augen haben sollte, da darauf der Rest der Arbeit \naufbaut. Hierbei ist es nicht unbedingt notwendig, bereits alles ins Reine zu formulieren – \ninhaltlich sollte sie jedoch ausgefeilt sein.\nEine gute Einleitung besteht immer aus vier Teilen: Problemstellung, Zielsystem, Bear-\nbeitungsmethode  und Aufbau der Arbeit . – Alle vier Punkte sind für das Gelingen der \nArbeit extrem wichtig. Wir wollen daher auf jeden einzelnen im Folgenden ausführlich eingehen.\n2.4.2.1\nProblemstellung\nDie Problemstellung stellt das methodische Problem und die Herausforderung eines \nThemas dar und bildet den Startpunkt einer jeden Arbeit. Sie sollte nicht verwechselt \nwerden mit der Relevanz des Themas. Dieser Fehler wird häufig gemacht und dabei übersehen, dass sich aus der schieren Relevanz eines Themas noch keine Herausforde-\nrungen ergeben, die in der Arbeit angegangen werden könnten. Die Relevanz eines The-\nmas stellt einen Ist-Zustand dar. Mit ihm wird höchstens die Wichtigkeit des Themas untermauert, aber nicht die damit verbundene Problemstellung.\nB Das Thema der Arbeit lautet „Entwicklung eines Online-Marketing-Konzeptes für ein Handelsunternehmen“. Der Verfasser der Arbeit schreibt zur Problemstellung Folgen-des: „Das Internet wird in der heutigen Zeit immer wichtiger. Daher können Umzugs-\nunternehmen es sich nicht erlauben, vom Gebrauch des Internets und Online-Marke-\ntings abzusehen […].“\nDas, was der Verfasser schreibt, ist kein Problem, sondern die Beschreibung eines Ist-\nZustands. Davon abgesehen, dass dieser Ist-Zustand an sich noch anzweifelbar wäre \n(denn auch heute noch kommen sehr viele Unternehmen sehr gut ohne Online-Marke-ting aus), lässt die vorliegende „Problemstellung“ kein Problem erkennen. Aus den \nWorten des Verfassers lässt sich lediglich die vermeintliche Relevanz des Themas \nableiten. Um die geht es unter dem Punkt „Problemstellung“ aber nicht vordringlich.\nEine solche Verwechslung von Problemstellung und Relevanz des Themas wirkt sich \npotenziell verheerend auf die Arbeit aus. Denn an der Problemstellung hat sich die ge-\nsamte übrige Arbeit auszurichten, sie ist damit richtungsweisend. Daher kann sie gar \nnicht wichtig genug genommen werden. Aus der Problemstellung muss deutlich hervor-gehen, warum ein Thema nicht trivial ist: Was ist der Knackpunkt, was ist das methodi-\nsche Problem?\nDie Problemstellung im Rahmen des oben genannten Themas ist damit vielmehr, wie \ndie Instrumente des Online-Marketing identifiziert und ihre Wirkung für das Unterneh-\nmen analysiert werden können.

2\nåSQL3012.4.2.2\nZielsystem\nAuf der Grundlage einer zutreffend dargestellten Problemstellung, die in der Regel \nnicht mehr als 20 Zeilen Umfang benötigt, kann der zweite Punkt der Einleitung bear-beitet werden: das Zielsystem.\nNeben der Problemstellung ist auch das Zielsystem von großer Bedeutung für die \nArbeit. Hier werden die Ziele der Untersuchung benannt und strukturiert. Diese ergeben \nsich aus der Problemstellung, da in einer wissenschaftlichen Arbeit primär das Ziel ver-folgt wird, die Problemstellung zu lösen. Es ist aber nicht mit der direkten Überführung \nder Problemstellung in Ziele getan. Warum nicht, kann am obigen Beispiel verdeutlicht \nwerden: Die Probleme der Arbeit lagen in der Identifikation und Analyse von Instru-menten im Online-Marketing sowie in der Entwicklung einer Methode zur optimalen \nZusammenstellung der Instrumente.\nB In Summe kann mit der Lösung dieser Probleme ein Online-Marketing-Konzept für \nein Handelsunternehmen entwickelt werden. Dies ist gleichzeitig das oberste Ziel der Arbeit. Die Lösung der genannten Probleme sind hieraus abgeleitete Ziele:\nOberstes Ziel:\n– Online-Marketing-Konzept für ein Handelsunternehmen entwickeln\nZiele der zweiten Ebene:\n– Instrumente des Online-Marketing identifizieren\n– Wirkung der Instrumente des Online-Marketing analysieren\n– Methode zur Entwicklung eines Gesamtkonzeptes erstellen\nAuch wenn diese Ziele der zweiten Ebene das oberste Ziel schon etwas ausdifferenzie-\nren und konkretisieren, so wird es den meisten doch schwer fallen, diese Ziele in einem \nSchritt zu erreichen. Daher ist eine weitere Differenzierung sinnvoll. Hierfür soll das \nerste Ziel der zweiten Ebene betrachtet werden:\nInstrumente des Online-Marketing identifizieren\nZiele der dritten Ebene:\n– Generelle Marketing-Instrumente identifizieren\n– Online-Marketing vom generellen Marketing abgrenzen\n– Übertragbarkeit der Instrumente prüfen\n– Anpassungsbedarf für die Instrumente prüfen\nDiese Ziele der dritten Ebene sind wieder  erheblich konkreter als die der zweiten \nEbene. Setzt man diese Ausdifferenzierung schrittweise fort, erreichen die Ziele einen \nKonkretisierungsgrad, der eine direkte Überführung in Handlungen zur Zielerreichung ermöglicht.

2\nåSQL301Auf diese Weise kann das oberste Ziel durch zunehmende Ausdifferenzierung und Kon-\nkretisierung in Arbeitsschritte und Meilensteine überführt werden. Damit ist das gut \nausgearbeitete Zielsystem einer wissenschaftlichen Arbeit gleichzeitig der Arbeitsplan \nfür deren Fertigstellung. Die nachfolgende Abbildung zeigt den Prozess der Ausdiffe-renzierung noch einmal am Beispiel eines Zielstranges auf.\nAbbildung 7:\nAusdifferenzierung eines \nZielsystems für eine \nwissenschaftliche Arbeit\nDie genaue Erfassung der Problemstellung einer wissenschaftlichen Arbeit und die Ab-\nleitung und Ausdifferenzierung von Zielen aus dieser Problemstellung stellen eine we-sentliche Herausforderung beim Erstellen jeder wissenschaftlichen Arbeit dar. Hierbei \nist es unerheblich, um welche Art von Arbeit es sich handelt – eine Problemstellung und \nein Zielsystem sollten in jedem Fall entwickelt werden. Wenn auch in unterschiedlicher Intensität. Ob und in wie weit Ziele auf unteren Ebenen explizit in der Arbeit dargestellt \nwerden müssen, legt der Autor immer individuell vor dem Hintergrund des Umfanges \nund der Ausrichtung der Arbeit fest.\nMit einem derartigen Zielsystem steht die Struktur weitgehend fest und alle nötigen \nHandlungen zum Lösen der Problemstellung sind bekannt. Danach geht es „nur“ noch \nans Umsetzen.\nDas Zielsystem hat aber auch noch einen weiteren Vorteil im Rahmen der Anfertigung der \nArbeit: Es zeigt sehr klar auf, welche Textbestandteile zur Problembearbeitung unmittel-bar dazugehören. Daher sollten Sie sich als Au tor einer wissenschaftlichen Arbeit nach \nAbschluss jedes Abschnittes fragen, welche Ziele Sie mit dieser Textpassage erreicht \nhaben. Sollte es kein zugehöriges Ziel gebe n, gehört der Text mit großer Wahrscheinlich-\nkeit auch nicht zur Lösung der Problemstellung und damit auch nicht in die Arbeit.\n2.4.2.3\nBearbeitungsmethode\nIm dritten Teil der Einleitung sollte die Methode der Bearbeitung beschrieben werden. \nDenn häufig hängen die Ziele methodisch so zusammen, dass sie zwingend in einer \nbestimmten Reihenfolge bearbeitet werden müssen. Die Gesamtheit der in eine logische Reihenfolge gebrachten Ziele stellen die Methode der Bearbeitung dar. Da es hier nun \num operative Anliegen geht, empfiehlt es sich in vielen Fällen, ein Ablaufdiagramm zu \nerstellen, das auch in die Arbeit integriert werden kann.

darstellen. Hierbei \nwerden die einzelnen methodischen Schritte mit Kapitelzahlen in Verbindung gebracht, \nsodass der Leser erkennen kann, in welchem Kapitel oder Abschnitt welche Schritte \nvollzogen und welche Ziele erreicht werden sollen. Bei diesem Punkt sollte das Inhalts-verzeichnis also nicht einfach nacherzählt werden. Das wäre überflüssig, der Leser \nkönnte diese Information viel einfacher dem Inhaltsverzeichnis selbst entnehmen. Der \nMehrwert des Aufbaus der Arbeit gegenüber dem Inhaltsverzeichnis ist, dass er erläu-tert, wie die einzelnen Teile (Kapitel, Abschnitte etc.) miteinander verknüpft sind.\nK[5] Erläutern Sie, was unter Problemstellung zu verstehen ist. Sagen Sie auch, was nicht damit gemeint ist.\nK[20] Was ist eine Zielhierarchie?\nK[15] Sollte im Abschnitt „Aufbau der Arbeit“ das Inhaltsverzeichnis nacherzählt werden?\n2.4.3\nGrundlagen\nIm Anschluss an die Einleitung geht es um die theoretischen oder allgemeinen Grund-\nlagen . Hierin werden die für die spezielle Thematik und deren Problematik erforder-\nlichen Begriffe und Konzepte erklärt. Di eser Grundlagenteil kann auch mal aus zwei \noder drei Kapiteln bestehen.\nIn diesem Kapitel geht es in der Regel nicht darum, eine spezielle Theorie wiederzuge-\nben oder gar zu entwickeln. Dafür ist in der typischen wissenschaftlichen Arbeit z. B. an \neiner Hochschule weder Raum noch Bedarf. Der Grundlagenteil sollte daher nicht mit \n„Theorie“ oder „Theoretische Grundlagen“ übe rschrieben werden, sondern schlicht mit \n„Konzeptionelle Grundlagen“ oder Ähnlichem.

Aus der Problemstellung  muss hervorgehen, wel-\nches die zentralen Fragen sind, die durch die jeweilige Thematik aufgeworfen wer-\nden. Im Zielsystem  werden auf der Grundlage der konkreten Problemstellung die \nZiele der Untersuchung definiert. Dies geschieht in hierarchischer Form, wobei Final- und Teilziele unterschieden werden und ein Ergebnistyp festgelegt wird.

2\nåSQL301Theorien tatsächlich erforderlich ist, sollten diese aufgenommen und der Titel des Kapi-\ntels entsprechend angepasst werden.\nMit dem Grundlagenteil sollen vor allem die zentralen Begriffe geklärt sowie die erfor-\nderlichen Methoden und Konzepte vorgestellt werden.\n2.4.3.1\nDefinitionen\nVor der inhaltlichen Auseinandersetzung mit der gewählten Thematik sind zentrale \nBegriffe zu klären, damit eine eindeutige und präzise Verwendung der Begrifflichkeiten \ngewährleistet ist. Im Rahmen der Begriffserklärung sind drei verschiedene Arten zu unterscheiden:\nPBegriffe mit einem universellen Verständnis müssen in der Regel nicht explizit defi-\nniert werden. Bei solchen Begriffen und Ausdrücken kann davon ausgegangen wer-\nden, dass eine eindeutige und einheitliche Kommunikationsgrundlage gegeben ist.\nPThemenrelevante Fachbegriffe werden benötigt, um im Grundlagenteil die notwen-\ndigen Methoden und Konzepte zu erläutern. Sie können per Fußnotentext definiert \nwerden, um den Lesefluss nicht zu stören. Wird eine größere Anzahl von Fachter-\nmini verwendet, dann ist es hilfreich, die Definitionen und Erläuterungen in einem Glossar zusammenzustellen. Ein Glossar sollte im Anhang einer Arbeit positioniert \nwerden.\nPZentrale Begriffe prägen die gesamte Themenstellung. Es sind häufig Ausdrücke, die \nim Titel der Arbeit zu finden sind. Bei zentralen Begriffen ist zu prüfen, ob sie in der Fachliteratur einheitlich interpretiert und verwendet werden. Gegebenenfalls müssen \nverschiedene Sichtweisen und Interpretationen in der eigenen Studie vorgestellt wer-\nden, um dann die Unterschiede oder Gemeinsamkeiten in den Definitionen zu erör-tern. Vor diesem Hintergrund ist dann explizit festzulegen, in welchem Verständnis \nder Ausdruck in der eigenen Arbeit verwendet wird.\nGrundsätzlich sollten die Auseinandersetzung mit den Begriffen und die Begriffsdefini-\ntion in einer wissenschaftlichen Arbeit nicht übermäßig viel Raum einnehmen. So kön-nen in einer Bachelorarbeit die zentralen Begriffe bei den meisten Themen sicherlich \nauf ca. einer bis eineinhalb Seiten diskutiert und definiert werden. In einer Masterarbeit \nkann jedoch die Begriffsklärung durchaus zwei oder drei Seiten umfassen.\nB Im Rahmen der Bachelorarbeit zum Thema „Gamification als Marketinginstrument im stationären Handel – Untersuchung der Einsatzmöglichkeiten und der Erfolgspoten-ziale“ (Inhaltsverzeichnis siehe oben) sind die Ausdrücke „Gamification“ und „statio-\nnärer Handel“ als zentrale Begriffe anzuse hen. Für den Ausdruck „Marketinginstru-\nment“ würde sich eine Einstufung als „Fachbegriff“ anbieten, da eine differenzierte Auseinandersetzung mit diesem Terminus zu viel Platz in der Arbeit benötigen würde. \nDie Begriffsklärung für den Ausdruck „Gamification“ könnte wie folgt gestaltet werden:\nDer Begriff „Gamification“ findet seinen Ur sprung in der englischen Sprache und \nkann im deutschen Sprachraum mit „Spie lifizierung“ übersetzt werden.

2\nåSQL301handelt es sich um ein junges und sehr aktuelles Modewort, welches zwar auf das \nJahr 1978 zurückgeht, jedoch erst seit 2010 zunehmend an Bedeutung gewinnt. Des-\nhalb fehlt noch eine einheitliche Definition in der Fachliteratur.\nEinen ersten akademischen Ansatz zur Definition des Begriffs Gamification lieferte \n2011 Sebastian Deterding: „Gamification is the use of game design elements in non-\ngame context“. Diese Definition wird von Nora S. Stampfl, Unternehmensberaterin \nund Zukunftsforscherin, erweitert und hinsichtlich des Zielaspekts verfeinert. Entspre-chend wird Gamification definiert als „… bewusste Nutzbarmachung von Spielmecha-\nnismen, um die Motivation von Menschen zu wecken und sie zu ganz bestimmten Ver-\nhalten zu animieren.“\nAnhand dieser Definitionen kann festgehalten werden, dass es sich bei dem Begriff \nGamification um einen Ansatz handelt, der bei Menschen u. a. Partizipation, Engage-\nment und Motivation fördern soll, indem Spielmechanismen bzw. Game-Design-Ele-\nmente in einem Kontext außerhalb von Spielen angewendet werden. Für die vorlie-\ngende Arbeit soll folgende aggregierte und vereinfachte Definition zugrunde gelegt werden: „Gamification beschreibt den Einsatz von Spielmechanismen außerhalb von \nSpielen, um eine bestimmte Verhaltens änderung beim Nutzer herbeizuführen“.\n2.4.3.2\nKonzepte und Methoden\nDen zweiten wichtigen Teil der Grundlagen nehmen die zentralen Konzepte und Metho-\nden im Rahmen der Arbeit ein. So ergibt sich aus der Entwicklung des Zielsystems meist, dass bestimmte Konzepte in der Arbeit zur Anwendung kommen sollen, die einer \nvorherigen Erläuterung bedürfen. So erfordert beispielsweise die Optimierung eines Da-\ntenmodells die Kenntnis, was genau Datenmodelle sind, welche Formen es gibt und wie sie sich in welcher Hinsicht unterscheiden. Kurz: Das Konzept des Datenmodells muss \ndargestellt werden. Ähnlich verhält es sich in einer betriebswirtschaftlichen Arbeit, wenn \nbeispielsweise ein neues System zur internen Leistungsverrechnung erstellt werden soll. Hier sind zunächst die Grundlagen zur internen Leistungsverrechnung im Zusammen-\nhang mit der Kostenrechnung darzustellen, um eine Basis für die Entwicklung des Sys-\ntems zu legen.\nNeben diesen Konzepten kommen häufig auch wissenschaftliche Methoden zur An-\nwendung, die gesondert beschrieben werden sollten. Beispielsweise verwenden viele \nStudierende im Rahmen ihrer Arbeiten eine Nutzwertanalyse, um mehrere Gestaltungs-\noptionen zu bewerten. Diese – wenn auch vergleichsweise einfache – Methode sollte dann im Rahmen von methodischen Grundlagen dargestellt und erläutert werden. \nHierzu gehört auch, dass eventuelle Defizite der Methoden benannt werden und dar-\ngestellt wird, warum diese vertretbar erscheinen.\nAm Ende des Grundlagen-Kapitels sollte eine Zusammenführung der Grundlagen mit \ndem eigentlichen Thema und der Problemstellung der Arbeit in Form von sogenannten \n„Lessons-Learned“ erfolgen. Schließlich geht es nicht um die Grundlagen an sich, son-\ndern um die Grundlagen in der Funktion, die im Zielsystem verankerten Forschungs-vorhaben erfolgreich zu erfüllen.	{"source": "book.pdf", "page": 80}	b47aec76-845d-11ee-87d1-5686f88fa7cd	7d69aff6-3b0c-476e-9e4f-9e0bc0dc43f5

2\nåSQL301K[7] Welche Begriffe sollten im Rahmen der Grundlagen definiert werden?\nK[25] Werden in den Grundlagen Theorien dargestellt?\n2.4.4\nHauptteil\nDer Hauptteil, der bei einigen Arbeiten auch als „Konzeptteil“ bezeichnet wird, bildet \ndas Herzstück jeder Arbeit. Hier wird nach den Vorarbeiten in den Grundlagen das Pro-\nblem konkret angegangen. Mit dem Hauptteil zeigen Sie, dass Sie dem Thema gewach-sen sind und es einer Lösung zuführen können. Daher sollte der Hauptteil nicht zu \nwenig Raum einnehmen. Er umfasst bei der AKAD University üblicherweise etwa die \nHälfte bis zwei Drittel der gesamten Arbeit.\nDer Hauptteil sollte direkt auf den Grundla gen aufbauen und deren Ergebnisse direkt \neinfließen lassen. Hierzu müssen immer wieder Rückbezüge  eingearbeitet werden, aus \ndenen ersichtlich wird, welche Ergebnisse der Grundlagen an welchen Stellen im \nHauptteil verwendet werden.\nBewertung eines\nKonzeptesWenn die Arbeit auf die Bewertung eines Konzeptes  oder Zustandes ausgelegt ist, ist \nes die Aufgabe des Hauptteils, dieses Urteil stringent und nachvollziehbar herzuleiten. Je besser hierbei die einzelnen Teilaspekte begründet und argumentiert werden, desto \nüberzeugender ist die abschließende Beurteilung.\nEntwicklung eines\nKonzeptesSoll ein Konzept entwickelt  werden, lassen sich im Wesentlichen zwei Ansätze unter-\nscheiden: Die Neuentwicklung und die Optimierung eines Konzeptes oder Systems.\nBei der Neuentwicklung eines Systems  sind vor allem die konzeptionellen und methodi-\nschen Grundlagen heranzuziehen, um vor dem Hintergrund der gegebenen Situation im \nUnternehmen ein angemessenes System zu konfigurieren. Hierbei sollten alle Entschei-dungen im Rahmen der Gestaltung eingehend begründet und nachvollziehbar argumen-\ntiert werden. Am Ende der Entwicklung ist es besonders wichtig, die einzelnen Teil-\naspekte zu einer Gesamtlösung zu integrieren.\nDie Optimierung einer bestehenden Lösung  kann als selektive Neuentwickelung be-\ntrachtet werden. Hierbei werden ausgehend von einem Ist-Zustand die Defizite der be-\nstehenden Lösung herausgearbeitet. Für diese Defizite werden dann mithilfe der \nkonzeptionellen und methodischen Grundlagen Lösungsansätze entwickelt. Auch hier muss am Ende die Integration der neuen und der alten Komponenten der Lösung voll-Der Grundlagenteil einer wissenschaftlichen Arbeit kann durchaus mehrere Kapitel umfassen. Mit ihm wird die Basis für die Konzeptentwicklung oder die konkrete Problemlösung im Hauptteil gelegt.

2\nåSQL301zogen werden, damit sichergestellt ist, dass die verschiedenen Komponenten reibungs-\nlos zusammenarbeiten können.\nNeben theoretischen Themen werden in den Abschlussarbeiten der AKAD University \nhäufig konkrete Problemlösungen für betriebliche Zustände erarbeitet, wie z. B. „Erstel-lung einer Talent-Management-Konzeption zur Identifizierung, gezielten Weiterent-\nwicklung und Bindung von Talenten in Unternehmen XYZ“ oder:  „Verbesserung der \nLagerlogistik von Luftfahrtmaterialien in einem luftfahrttechnischen Betrieb (LTB).“ Bei derartigen unternehmensbezogenen Themen sollte im Hauptteil zunächst das Unter-\nsuchungsobjekt vorgestellt werden, um dann den konkreten Ist-Zustand als Ausgangs-\npunkt der Untersuchung darzustellen. Bei der Analyse des gegenwärtigen Zustands kommt es darauf an, Defizite oder Schwächen möglichst konkret und objektiv zu erfas-\nsen. Die subjektive Wahrnehmung des Autors ist dafür nicht geeignet. Fundierter lassen \nsich solche Bewertungen durch Mitarbeiterb efragungen oder Interviews mit internen \nExperten gewinnen. Zudem sollte in der zu erstellenden Abschlussarbeit ein Stichtag \nfür die Erfassung des Ist-Zustands festgelegt werden. Ansonsten kann es vorkommen, \ndass sich der Zustand im Unternehmen während der Bearbeitung des Themas laufend verändert.\nEine sinnvolle Abrundung für eine erarbeitete betriebliche Lösung ist ein Umsetzungs- \nund Implementierungsplan. Auf ca. zwei bis fünf Seiten können hier konkrete Meilen-\nsteine definiert und Verantwortliche benannt werden und so auch die weitere Vorge-hensweise dokumentiert werden.\nÄhnlich verhält es sich mit der ökonomischen Bewertung einer erarbeiteten Problemlö-\nsung. In vielen Fällen stellt sich die Frage, ob sich die Einführung des entwickelten \nKonzepts am Ende auszahlen würde oder nicht. Eine umfassende und fundierte Bewer-tung ist jedoch in der Regel im Rahmen des Bearbeitungszeitraums nicht möglich. Oft \nfehlt zudem der Zugang zu internen Daten und Informationen. Es ist jedoch sinnvoll, im \nRahmen der wissenschaftlichen Arbeit zumindest eine Vorgehensweise bzw. die Prob-lematik selbst anzusprechen, um zu verdeutlichen, dass diese Bewertung nicht einfach \nvergessen worden ist. \nK[11] Welche Formen lassen sich im Rahmen der Konzeptentwicklung unterscheiden?\nK[27] Warum ist die ökonomische Bewertung einer Problemlösung im Rahmen einer wissen-\nschaftlichen Arbeit häufig problematisch?\nK[52] Ist auch für ein Assignment mit seinen acht bis zwölf Seiten ein Grundlagen- und ein \nHauptteil erforderlich?Im Hauptteil der Arbeit geht es darum, die Problemlösung zu entwickeln. Steht hier-\nbei die Bewertung eines Konzeptes oder eines Zustandes im Fordergrund, zählt vor \nallem die nachvollziehbare Herleitung des Urteils.\nSollte ein Konzept entwickelt werden, kann man zwischen der Neuentwicklung und \nder Optimierung unterscheiden.

2\nåSQL3012.4.5\nSchluss\nDas letzte Kapitel einer Arbe it bildet den Schlussstein. Hi erbei kommt es nicht auf den \nUmfang der Arbeit an – jede wissenschaftliche Arbeit sollte einen formalen Schluss haben.\nWie auch die Einleitung, setzt sich der Schluss einer guten wissenschaftlichen Arbeit \naus vier Teilen zusammen: Der Zusammenfassung , einer kritischen Auseinandersetzung \nmit der eigenen Vorgehensweise , einer Betrachtung eventueller Erfolgsfaktoren  und \neinem Ausblick . Während in der Einleitung jedoch alle vier Teile immer relevant sind, \nkönnen die letzen beiden Teile des Schlusses bei einigen Themen wegfallen.\nMit der Zusammenfassung werden die wesentlichen Ergebnisse der eigenen Arbeit \ndokumentiert und zusammenfassend dargestellt. Die inhaltliche Auseinandersetzung \nmit der Themenstellung ist an dieser Stelle bereits abgeschlossen – das war ja die Auf-gabe im Hauptteil – sodass in der Zusammenfassung keine neuen Argumente oder Ein-\nsichten vorgebracht werden. Sinnvoll ist es, in dieser Zusammenfassung das finale Ziel \nder eigenen Studie aus der Einleitung aufzugreifen und den Umfang der Zielerreichung zu dokumentieren. Dabei bezieht sich die Zusammenfassung auf die gesamte Arbeit \nund nicht nur auf den Hauptteil oder eine empirische Erhebung.\nB In der Bachelorarbeit zum Thema „Gamification“ wurde die Zusammenfassung folgen-\ndermaßen gestaltet:\nDas Ziel der vorliegenden Arbeit war es, Gamification als Instru ment des Marketing-\nmix zu erklären und daneben eine konkrete Vorgehensweise zur Entwicklung einer Gamification-Anwendung für stationäre Einzelhändler zu entwickeln, welche auf der \nGrundlage von wesentlichen Erfolgsfaktoren und der Analyse ausgewählter Fallbei-\nspiele erarbeitet wurde. Zudem wurden Erkenntnisse der empirischen Untersuchung innerhalb der Handlungsempfehlungen berücksichtigt, welche besonders unterschied-\nliche Spielpräferenzen und Einkaufsgewohnheiten von Konsumenten verdeutlichen.“\nIm Anschluss an die Zusammenfassung erfolgt die kritische Würdigung der Arbeit, in \nwelcher die Validität der Re sultate hinterfragt wird. Hi er können Schwächen der Vor-\ngehensweise in der eigenen Arbeit und Punkte angesprochen werden, die noch ausbau-fähig gewesen wären. Hierzu kann beispielsweise gehören, dass eine Umfrage nicht so \nbreit angelegt werden konnte, wie dies für repräsentative Schlussfolgerungen erforder-\nlich gewesen wäre oder dass einige Daten nicht zur Verfügung standen.\nDurch die kritische Auseinandersetzung mit der eigenen Arbeit stellt der Autor klar, \ndass er sich der Defizite seiner Arbeit bewusst ist und ihm diese nicht „aus Versehen“ \nunterlaufen sind. Hierin ist eine besondere Qualifikation des Autors zu sehen, denn eine \nperfekte wissenschaftliche Arbeit wird kaum jemandem gelingen.\nB In der Bachelorarbeit zum Thema „Gamification“ könnte die kritische Würdigung bei-spielsweise folgende Elemente umfassen:\nAufgrund des beschränkten Umfangs der vorliegenden Arbeit konnten verschiedene \nThemenbereiche nur ansatzweise betrachtet werden.

2\nåSQL301von menschlichen Bedürfnissen, Motivationstheorien und dem Flow-Erlebnis erörtert \nwerden. Die Übertragung dieser Theorien in Spielelemente konnte zudem auch nur \ngrundlegend erarbeitet werden.\nHinsichtlich der im Kapitel 3.4 identifizierten Erfolgsfaktoren für den Gamification-\nAnsatz konnten zwar theoretisch fundierte Faktoren identifiziert werden, jedoch wäre \neine Befragung von Unternehmen, die Gamification einsetzen, vorteilhafter gewesen. \nDa sich der Gamification-Ansatz jedoch gerade erst in Deutschland etabliert und es entsprechend noch nicht viele Unternehmen gibt, wurde von einer Befragung abgese-\nhen.\nWenn es Umstände gibt, die für die Wirksamkeit eines erarbeiteten Konzepts gegeben \nsein müssen, dann ist eine Auseinandersetzung mit den kritischen Erfolgsfaktoren in \ndiesem abschließenden Kapitel erforderlich. Damit sind sogenannte erfolgsdiskriminie-rende Faktoren gemeint, die den Erfolg von Konzepten determinieren. So kann es bei-\nspielsweise geschehen, dass ein Kundenbindungskonzept, das auf der Speicherung von \numfangreichen Kundendaten basiert, durch eine Änderung der rechtlichen Rahmenbe-dingungen bezüglich des Datenschutzes hinfällig wird. Eine neue Technologie könnte \nandererseits im IT-Bereich ein erarbeitetes Programm hinfällig machen. \nMit dem Ausblick auf die zukünftigen Entwicklungen wird der Kreis zur Einleitung \ngeschlossen. Dort wurde der Leser zunächst allgemein in die Problemstellung einge-führt, um dann die konkreten Herausforderungen zu erfahren. Nun, zum Abschluss der \nArbeit, können konkrete Entwicklungen in den Gesamtzusammenhang von grundlegen-\nden Trends gestellt und zukünftige Szenarien skizziert werden. Dieser Ausblick umfasst bei den meisten Abschlussarbeiten der AKAD University ca. eine halbe bis dreiviertel \nSeite, je nach Thema, sodass Entwicklungen nur grob angesprochen werden können.\nB In der Bachelorarbeit zum Thema „Gamification“ wurde ein sehr aktuelles Thema auf-\ngegriffen, sodass sich folgender Ausblick anbietet:\nWie bereits im Kapitel 2.2.3 erwähnt, prognostiziert das Marktforschungsunterneh-\nmen Gartner ein enormes Wachstum für die Gamification-Ansätze. Auch der Bundes-\nverband des Deutschen Versandhandels e.V. hat Unternehmen befragt, wo diese in \nZukunft ihren Schwerpunkt im Bereich des Mobile Commerce sehen. Mit 4,88 Prozent \nwurde der Gamification noch am wenigsten Beachtung gegeben. Dieses Ergebnis dürfte aus heutiger Sicht viel höher ausfallen.\nDie Entwicklung des Gamification-Ansatzes in Deutschland ist jedoch auch erheblich \nvon den rech tlichen Rahme nbedingungen abhängig, die die Spielregel n hinsichtlich \nGamification beeinflussen werden. Datenschutz ist ein hochsensibles Thema in \nDeutschland und unterliegt anderen Voraussetzungen wie in den USA, dem Geburts-land von Gamification.  Zudem ist technologische Entwicklung in den Bereichen des \nmobilen Internets zu berücksichtigen.

2\nåSQL301K[49] Nennen Sie die vier Punkte, die im Schluss der Arbeit behandelt werden sollten.\nK[51] In einem Assignment wird als „Zusammenfassung“ folgende Passage präsentiert:\n„Ziel der Arbeit war es, fünf konkrete Hypothesen über die Auswirkungen der Meno-\npause bei Frauen auf die Leistungsfähigkeit im Beruf zu entwickeln. Dies ist vor dem \nHintergrund der notwendigen Begriffsdefinition von Hypothesen und Menopause sowie der Darstellung erforderlicher Grundlagen eigenständig erfolgt.\nKritisch ist zu beachten, dass es sich bei der Problemstellung um ein diagnostisches \nForschungsproblem handelt. Der Umfang der Arbeit lässt es jedoch nicht zu, die Fülle \nan Wissen, welches über den Sachverhalt der Menopause bereits existiert, in Gänze \nabzubilden und kritisch zu diskutieren. Des Weiteren stellt die Problemstellung ein vorwiegend medizinisches bzw. psychologisches Themengebiet dar, für welches die \nFachexpertise des Autors für eine objektive Bewertung der aufgestellten Hypothesen \nnicht ausreichend ist. Dennoch konnten die geforderten fünf Hypothesen definiert und somit das Ziel der Arbeit vollumfänglich erreicht werden.“\nBeurteilen Sie diese Zusammenfassung, indem Sie eine Schulnote dafür vergeben und \nbegründen Sie Ihre Einschätzung.\n2.4.6\nBewertungskriterien für wissenschaftliche Arbeiten\nEbenso wie die Erarbeitung einer wissenschaftlichen Arbeit ein sehr strukturierter Pro-\nzess sein sollte, so folgt auch die Beguta chtung einer wissenschaftlichen Arbeit einer \nfesten Systematik. Hierbei unterscheidet sich diese Systematik bei den unterschiedli-chen Arbeitstypen nicht wesentlich, da Ansprüche wie Nachvollziehbarkeit, Stringenz \nund Strukturiertheit für alle gelten.\nDie nachfolgende Tabelle stellt wesentliche Bewertungsaspekte für Studienarbeiten \nüberblicksartig dar und bringt sie mit Fragen in Verbindung, die sich ein Gutachter zur Bewertung der Aspekte typischerweise stellt:Im abschließenden Kapitel einer wissenschaftlichen Arbeit werden die wesentlichen Erkenntnisse dokumentiert, die Vorgehensweise kritisch gewürdigt sowie ein Aus-blick auf die zukünftigen Entwicklungen erarbeitet. Zudem können diejenigen Fak-\ntoren erläutert werden, von denen die Lösung abhängig ist. Neue themenrelevante \nInhalte sollten in diesem Fazit oder Resümee nicht mehr entwickelt werden, denn die inhaltliche Auseinandersetzung mit der Thematik ist im Hauptteil abzuschließen.

3\nåSQL3013\nWissenschaftliche Nacharbeit\nNachdem die Einleitung, die Grundlagen, der konzeptionelle Teil sowie der Schluss \ngeschrieben sind, hat man zwar das Gröbste hinter sich, ist aber noch nicht fertig. Denn \ndie wissenschaftliche Nacharbeit steht noch aus. Hierzu zählen vor allem ein sorgfälti-\nges Lektorat und das Layout der gesamten Arbeit (vgl. Niederhauser, 2006, S. 25 f.).\nDas Lektorat sollte zum einen auf die Argumentation und Gedankenführung in der \nArbeit eingehen und prüfen, ob alles Wichtige stringent und nachvollziehbar dargestellt \nwurde. Zum anderen widmet sich das Lektorat aber auch der formalen Korrektheit des \nManuskriptes und prüft Rechtschreibung und Zeichensetzung sowie Darstellung von Verzeichnissen, Abbildungen, Fußnoten und Ähnlichem.\nZum Schluss sind die Arbeiten am Layout vorzunehmen. Hier wird die äußere Erschei-\nnungsform der gesamten Arbeit überprüft. Es geht etwa um die Seitenumbrüche, den \nSatzspiegel, die Position von Abbildungen un d Tabellen, die Schrifttype und die Schrift-\ngröße. Das äußere Erscheinungsbild der Arbeit hat sich auch nach gewissen Regeln und \nRichtlinien zu orientieren, auf die am Ende dieses Studienbriefs eingegangen wird.\n3.1\nLektorat\nDas Lektorat am Ende der Arbeit nimmt noch einmal einen erheblichen Einfluss auf die \nQualität Ihrer Arbeit. Denn die orthografische Korrektheit des Dokuments spiegelt die Sorgfalt, mit der es angefertigt wurde. Damit ist die korrekte Rechtschreibung keine \nreine Formsache, sondern trägt zur Glaubwürdigkeit des Autors bei.\nWas der Philosoph und Soziologe A\nDORNO  über den Schriftsteller sagt, gilt auch für \nden Autor einer wissenschaftlichen Arbeit:\n„Erste Vorsichtsmaßregel des Schriftstellers: jeden Text, jedes Stück, jeden Absatz \ndaraufhin durchzusehen, ob das zentrale Motiv deutlich genug hervortritt. Wer etwas \nausdrücken will, ist davon so bewegt, dass er sich treiben lässt, ohne darauf zu reflek-tieren. Man ist der Intention zu nah, „in Gedanken“, und vergisst zu sagen, was man \nsagen will.“\nUnd:\n„Keine Verbesserung ist zu klein oder geringfügig, als dass man sie nicht durchführen \nsollte. Von hundert Änderungen mag jede einzelne läppisch und pedantisch erschei-\nnen; zusammen können sie ein neues Niveau des Textes ausmachen.“\n1\nAutor als Lektor Das Ziel des Lektorats ist also, den Text auf ein „neues Niveau“ zu heben.

3\nåSQL301ner Texte ist jedoch, dass man immer die Intention, mit der man etwas geschrieben hat, \nkennt. Dadurch kann es vorkommen, dass Aspekte weggelassen wurden, die dem Autor \nselbstverständlich vorkamen – dies für den Leser aber nicht sind.\nExterner Lektor Daher ist es in der Regel sinnvoll, auch einen externen Lektor heranzuziehen. Denn für viele der eigenen Fehler ist man wie blind. Man liest über so manchen Fehler mehrfach \nhinweg, ein anderer sieht ihn gleich beim ersten Lesen. Die meisten Autoren einer wis-senschaftlichen Arbeit wählen daher jemanden aus dem Freundes- oder Kollegenkreis, \nder dazu bereit ist, ihre Arbeit durchzusehen. Natürlich sollte diese Person sattelfest im \nUmgang mit Texten sein und auch etwas Verständnis für den Inhalt haben. Denn nur dann kann sie tatsächlich beurteilen, ob die Argumentationen stringent sind.\nVerbesserungspotenzial\nMit großer Wahrscheinlichkeit hat ein gerade fertig gewordenes Manuskript einer wis-\nsenschaftlichen Arbeit Verbesserungspotenzial. Ziel des Lektorats ist es, dieses auszu-schöpfen. Man sollte bei vielen dieser Verbesserungspotenziale aber nicht von „Feh-\nlern“ oder „Fehlertypen“ sprechen. Denn die meisten Dinge, die hier im Folgenden \naufgezählt werden, sind nicht Fehler im buchstäblichen Sinn, abgesehen von der Recht-schreibung, Kommasetzung und eindeutig geregelten Formvorgaben.\nDamit Sie das Verbesserungspotenzial systematisch angehen können, sollten folgende \nBereiche in einer wissenschaftlichen Arbeit konsequent auf Verbesserungspotenzial \nuntersucht werden:\n1. Gedankenführung\n2. Gedankenwahl\n3. Gedankendarstellung\n4. Richtigkeit der Angaben5. Richtigkeit der Sprache\n1. Gedankenführung\nDa sich der Autor einer wissenschaftlichen Arbeit während des ersten Schreibens \nimmer auf einen bestimmten Aspekt konzentr iert und hierbei den nächsten zum Teil \nnoch gar nicht kennt und den vorhergegangenen eventuell auch nicht präsent hat, \nkommt es teilweise zu gedanklichen Brüchen. Diese erschweren die Nachvollziehbar-\nkeit des ganzen Textes dann erheblich.\nMan spricht in diesem Zusammenhang von einer mangelhaften Gedankenführung : Ein-\nzelne Gedanken werden nicht in den nächsten geführt, sondern stehen zusammenhang-\nlos nebeneinander. Um dieses Defizit zu beheben, muss der Text konsistent gemacht \nwerden, sprich: zusammenhängend. Das ist zumeist durch wenige Sätze zu bewerk-stelligen. Das geschieht, indem die Stellen zwischen zwei Gedanken, „Gelenkstellen“, \nwenn man so will, ausführlicher dargestellt werden. Wenn sinnvoll, werden hier Zu-\nsammenfassungen in Form von Zwischenresultaten festgehalten und es findet die Überführung des einen Gedankens in den nächsten statt.

3\nåSQL3012. Gedankenwahl\nMit der Arbeit an der Gedankenführung sollte die Arbeit an der Gedankenwahl einher-\ngehen, da erstere ein Prüfstein für die zweite ist: Bei der Gedankenführung können \nnatürlich nur diejenigen (Teil-)Gedanken zusammengeführt werden, die auch tatsäch-\nlich zusammengehören. Es geht nicht darum, künstlich oder willkürlich da „Gelenkstel-len“ zu erzeugen, wo gar keine zusammenhängenden „Gliedmaßen“ vorliegen. Denn eine wissenschaftliche Arbeit ist ein Text, der auf eine Textfrage antwortet. Diese wird \nin der Einleitung im Rahmen der Problemstellung eingehend vorgestellt und ausformu-\nliert. Aus ihr entsteht alles andere, sie ist die Rechtfertigung des ganzen Unterfangens. Aus der Textfrage werden Detailfragen abgeleitet, die in Detailkapiteln bearbeitet wer-\nden. Was wann wo behandelt wird, ergibt sich aus der Methode der Bearbeitung und \nmuss immer einleuchtend sein. Ebenso muss der Text sich in jedem neuen Abschnitt der Frage stellen, warum der jeweilige Detailaspekt wichtig ist und wie er mit der Problem-\nstellung zusammenhängt. Je sorgfältiger Sie aus der Problemstellung die Ziele der \nArbeit ableiten und diese zur Maßgabe der einzelnen Arbeitschritte machen, umso leichter wird es gelingen, die richtigen Gedanken und Überlegungen in eine richtige \nReihenfolge zu bringen.\n3. Gedankendarstellung\nLeicht schleichen sich überflüssige Gedanken in eine wissenschaftliche Arbeit ein. Ins-\nbesondere dann, wenn Studierende im Rahmen der Recherche auf generell Interessantes \nstoßen, ist die Versuchung groß, es in den Text aufzunehmen, auch wenn es eigentlich \ngar nicht passt. Solche nicht unmittelbar zur Problemstellung passenden Darstellungen \nfördern nicht die Kohärenz des Textes, sondern dessen Redundanz. Redundanz heißt \nÜberflüssigkeit, und der Text sollte so wenig wie möglich davon in sich haben.\nIm Rahmen eines Lektorats sollten daher auch nicht redundante Gedanken und Wieder-\nholungen gefunden und beseitigt werden. Das hierdurch der Umfang der Arbeit sinkt, ist meist eher positiv. Denn Redundanzen und unnötige Wiederholungen können eh \nnichts zum Erfolg der Arbeit beitragen.\nEin bedeutendes Problem vieler Studierender im Rahmen von wissenschaftlichen \nArbeiten ist die Frage: „Wie schreibt man eigentlich wissenschaftlich?“ Es ist allzu menschlich, in seinen alten Gewohnheiten zu verharren, was eben auch die Sprech-, \nSchreib- und Denkgewohnheiten anbelangt. Es ist daher nicht verwunderlich, wenn sich \nselbst noch in der Abschlussarbeit, der verschiedene kleiner wissenschaftliche Arbeiten vorangegangen sind, Stellen zu finden sind, die nicht „wissenschaftlich klingen“. Für \ndiese Stellen ist das Lektorat da, um hier gezielt Korrekturen vorzunehmen nach den \nbeschriebenen Kriterien.\nWissenschaftliche Ausdrucksweise zeichnet sich vor allem durch die Stilzüge der \nAbstraktheit, Objektivität, Modalität, Folgerichtigkeit, Klarheit, Genauigkeit und \nDichte aus. Hier sollte das Lektorat prüfen , ob diese Stilzüge ausreichend stark ange-\nwendet werden.

3\nåSQL3014. Richtigkeit der Angaben\nÜber die inhaltlichen und stilistischen Dinge hinaus sollten im Lektorat auch formale \nAspekte kontrolliert werden:\nPStimmen die Seitenzahlen ? Denn immer wieder gibt es Arbeiten, in denen einzelne \nSeiten doppelt sind oder welche fehlen.\nPSind die Autorennamen  richtig geschrieben? So gibt es beispielsweise einen Marke-\ntingwissenschaftler mit Namen Wolfgang Fritz – und der wird gerne auch mal als Fritz Wolfgang zitiert.\nPSind das Erscheinungsjahr  und der Erscheinungsort  korrekt wiedergegeben? Regel-\nmäßig kann man in wissenschaftlichen Arbeiten Zitate beispielsweise von Meier \n(2003) sehen – im Literaturverzeichnis findet sich aber nur Meier, G. (2005): Die Betrachtung des Wichtigen, Wuppertal.\nPSind die Zitate  richtig? Denn immer wieder finden sich in wissenschaftlichen Arbei-\nten Zitate, die sich so nicht im Originaltext finden. Zudem werden teilweise direkte \nund indirekte Zitate nicht ausreichend unterschieden.\nPBeachten Sie auch die im Kapitel zum Zitieren aufgeführten Plagiatsverstöße : Eine \nfehlende Angabe sollte also auch im Lektorat nachgetragen werden, sofern Sie sich \nnoch erinnern können, woher sie einen Gedanken bezogen haben.\n5. Richtigkeit der Sprache\nZu den formalen Aspekten des Lektorats zählt aber auch die eigentliche Form der \nArbeit. Hierbei setzt sich die Form aus zwei Kriterien zusammen: Rechtschreibung und \nZeichensetzung. Da eine wissenschaftliche Arbeit aus weiteren Komponenten besteht, \nkommen zur Beurteilung der Form weitere Kriterien hinzu. Nichtsdestotrotz sind die genannten Formkriterien Rechtschreibung (Orthografie)  und Zeichensetzung (Inter-\npunktion)  auch für wissenschaftliche Arbeiten vollgültig. Wer in Sachen Rechtschrei-\nbung und Zeichensetzung unsicher ist, tut gut daran, einen externen Lektor, der die nötige Sprachkompetenz mitbringt, einzuschalten. Kurz vor Abgabe sich noch die deut-\nsche Grammatik und Rechtschreibung aneignen zu wollen, ist ein utopisches Unterfan-\ngen, das von vornherein zum Scheitern verurteilt sein dürfte.\nWeitere Komponenten bei wissenschaftlichen Arbeiten sind als mögliche Fehlerquellen \nzu betrachten. Die Verzeichnisse , die Kapitelzählung , die Fußnoten , die Abbildungen  – \nsie alle sind auf formale Richtigkeit zu überprüfen.\nIn wissenschaftlichen Arbeiten sind Formfehler keine Kleinigkeit. Ab einer gewissen \nAnzahl werden sie von Korrektoren und anderen Lesern als Zeichen für mangelnde \nSorgfalt, Gründlichkeit und Gewissenhaftigkeit betrachtet. Schnell kommt es dann zu \nder Unterstellung, dass es dann auch mit dem Inhalt nicht weit her sein kann.

3\nåSQL301K[12] In welche Bereiche kann das Verbesserungspotenzial einer Arbeit unterteilt werden?\n3.2\nLayout\nWenn das Lektorat vollständig abgeschlossen wurde, können die Arbeiten am Layout  \nbeginnen. Beide zusammen erfüllen die formalen Vorgaben an eine wissenschaftliche \nArbeit. Ferner entsteht durch sie eine or dentliche und leserfreundliche Erscheinungs-\nform.\nEs ist darauf zu achten, dass mit dem Layout erst dann angefangen wird, wenn am Text \nkeine weiteren Änderungen mehr vorgenommen werden. Das heißt nicht, dass Sie nicht \nschon früher gewisse Vorkehrungen, die das Layout betreffen, vornehmen können. \nDazu ist sogar zu raten, beispielsweise die Seiteneinrichtung und die Schrifttype und -größe gleich zu Anfang so einzustellen, dass es den Anforderungen entspricht. Da-\ndurch erhalten Sie schon zu Anfang ein Gefühl für das Resultat, außerdem haben Sie \nmit Einstellungen, die Sie auf Anhieb richtig machen, später keine Arbeit mehr und müssen nichts mehr nachbessern.\nSolange Sie aber am Text arbeiten, wird dieser länger oder kürzer. Das wirkt sich direkt \nauch auf die Seitenumbrüche aus, wodurch es zu unbefriedigenden Resultaten kommen \nkann. Zum Beispiel könnte die letzte Zeile eines Absatzes am Seitenanfang oder umge-kehrt die erste Zeile eines Absatzes am Seitenende stehen. Berücksichtigen Sie auch, \ndass schon kleine Änderungen am Text sich auf die Darstellung von Abbildungen und \nTabellen im übrigen Dokument niederschlagen können, indem diese unkontrolliert hin- und hergeschoben werden. Um dieses in den Griff zu bekommen und auch hier keine \nWillkür walten zu lassen, bearbeitet man das Layout nach Abschluss des Lektorats, also \nganz am Ende der Arbeit.\nWissenschaftliche Arbeiten, die Sie verfassen, sollten nach gewissen formalen Vorga-\nben angefertigt werden. Sie sollten im Vorfeld klären, welche Vorgaben existieren. Fol-\ngende Einstellungen haben sich in der Praxis bewährt:\n– DIN-A4-Blätter (einseitig zu bedrucken);\n– Seitenrand links mit 4,5 cm; Seitenrand rechts mit 2,0 cm; Seitenrand oben/unten mit \nca. 3 cm;Ein wichtiger Arbeitsabschnitt in der Nacharbeit ist das Lektorieren. Es sollte sowohl durch den Verfasser selbst, aber zusätzlich auch durch einen externen Lektor durchgeführt werden.\nDas Ziel des Lektorats ist es, den Text auf ein neues Niveau zu heben und ihn zu \neinem sehr gut gearbeiteten Text zu machen.

hinreichend großen Zeilenschaltung.\nTitelblatt\nAuch das Titelblatt  ist ein wichtiger Aspekt innerhalb des Layouts einer wissenschaft-\nlichen Arbeit. Sowohl bei Powerpoint-Präsentationen als auch bei allen schriftlichen \nwissenschaftlichen Publikationen sollte ein Titelblatt vorgeschaltet werden, auf dem \nTitel, Autor, ggf. Anlass und sonstige, für den Leser wichtige oder gar unerlässliche Informationen abgedruckt werden.\nVerzeichnisse\nNach dem Inhaltsverzeichnis  haben die anderen Verzeichnisse zu folgen: Abbildungs-\nverzeichnis , Tabellenverzeichnis , ggf. Abkürzungsverzeichnis  und etwaige andere (wie \nz. B. Formelverzeichnis ). Darauf folgt der eigentliche Text, der oben in allen Gliede-\nrungspunkten beschrieben wurde. Hinter dem Text ist ggf. der Anhang anzubringen, der \nobligatorisch gefolgt ist von einem Literaturverzeichnis (Quellenverzeichnis) .\nK[33] Wann ist das Layout vorzunehmen und wozu führt das Layout?Das Layout der Arbeit ist am Schluss vorzunehmen, nachdem das Lektorat vollstän-\ndig abgeschlossen worden ist.\nBeim Layout ist eine Reihe unterschiedlicher Faktoren zu beachten.

Ziel des wissenschaftlichen Arbeitens ist es, ein anspruchsvolles Thema selbst-\nständig unter Anwendung der relevanten wissenschaftlichen Methoden verständlich \ndarzustellen. Die wissenschaftliche Methode basiert auf einer systematischen Vorge-\nhensweise, die sich in folgende Schritte gliedern lässt:\n– Wissenschaftliche Vorarbeit mit der Recherche und Materialbeschaffung\n– Wissenschaftliche Hauptarbeit mit der Gestaltung der wissenschaftlichen Studie– Wissenschaftliche Nacharbeit mit dem Lektorat und dem Layout\nDie Recherche bildet die Grundlage einer wissenschaftlichen Arbeit. Recherchieren \nheißt, sich gezielt kundig machen über ein bestimmtes Fachgebiet und dessen aktuellen \nForschungsstand. Hilfreich sind dabei eine Suchstrategie und Klassifikationen. Als Suchstrategien stehen grundsätzlich heuristische und systematische zur Verfügung, je \nnachdem ob man mit einem allgemeinen oder mit einem detaillierten Begriff beginnt. \nDaneben sollte die Klassifikation der Literatur berücksichtigt werden, insbesondere die Unterscheidung von selbstständigen und unselbstständigen Schriften sowie von Grauer \nLiteratur. Zu den selbstständigen Schriften gehören Monografien, also in sich geschlos-\nsene Texte von einem oder mehreren Autoren, die sich mit einem abgegrenzten The-menfeld befassen. Unselbstständige Schriften erscheinen zusammen mit den Beiträgen \nanderer Autoren. Als „Graue Literatur“ werden alle Publikationen und Quellen bezeich-\nnet, die nicht über die offiziellen Beschaffungskanäle zu erhalten sind. Daneben sind Bibliografien – sowohl Fach- wie auch Zeitschriftenbibliografien – für eine gezielte \nRecherche nach einem Thema von großer Bedeutung.\nFür Recherchen im Internet eignen sich Index- und Katalogsuchmaschinen. Die Vielfalt \nan Suchergebnissen lässt sich mit logischen Verknüpfungen auf der Basis der Bool ʼschen \nAlgebra einschränken. Zudem gibt es spezie lle Suchmaschinen, die ihre Recherche auf \nwissenschaftlich anspruchsvolle Texte konzentrieren, wie z. B. scholar.google und base-\nsearch.\nDaneben leisten Volltextdatenbanken wertvolle Dienste bei der Recherche. Sie stellen \ndas recherchierte Material in Form einer Datei zur Verfügung. Allerdings ist ihre Benut-\nzung teilweise kostenpflichtig. Schließlich sollten trotz Internet und digitaler Medien \ndie Fernleihe bzw. ein Besuch in einer Bibliothek als Recherchemöglichkeit nicht ver-nachlässigt werden.\nNach der Recherche und Materialbeschaffung ist die Lektüre der nächste Schritt. Für \neine rasche und gezielte Aufnahme der Fülle an Informationen ist der Einsatz von Lese-\ntechniken empfehlenswert. Gerade beim Studium wissenschaftlicher Texte sollten Fra-gen wie „welche Ziele werden in der Einleitung definiert“ oder „was sind die Schlüssel-\nwörter“ immer wieder im Geiste gestellt werden. Hand in Hand mit der Lektüre der \nrecherchierten Quellen sollte das erarbeitete Wissen archiviert werden.\nBei der Erstellung von wissenschaftlichen Arbeiten ist eine Reihe von Besonderheiten \nzu berücksichtigen. Dazu gehört die Gestaltung von Zitaten, sowohl direkten wie indi-\nrekten, um ein Plagiat zu vermeiden.

Vollbeleg werden alle bibliografischen Daten als Quellenangabe und im Litera-\nturverzeichnis angegeben. Die relevanten Angaben und deren Reihenfolge werden von \njeder Hochschule detailliert vorgegeben. Im Bereich der digitalen Medien entwickeln \nsich jedoch immer wieder neue Formen, sodass die Grundsätze für gedruckte Quellen-angaben entsprechend übertragen werden müssen. Von großer Bedeutung ist, dass die aufgeführten Quellen eindeutig zu identifizieren sind und wiedergefunden werden \nkönnen.\nBeim sogenannten Kurzbeleg finden sich die umfassenden bibliografischen Angaben \nnur im Literaturverzeichnis, während sich die Angaben im Text der Arbeit auf Nach-namen, Erscheinungsjahr bzw. Kurztitel und Fundort beschränken.\nFür firmeninterne Unterlagen, Gespräche mi t Mitarbeitern, Experteninterviews, For-\nmeln sowie Gesetze und Verordnungen existieren spezielle Vorgaben zur Gestaltung \nder Quellenangaben.\nAbbildungen und Tabellen sind in einer wissenschaftlichen Arbeit mit einer fortlaufen-\nden Nummerierung, einem Abbildungs- oder Tabellentitel sowie einer eigenständigen \nQuellenangabe zu gestalten.\nSchließlich ist der Schreibstil zu beachten. Die Ausführungen in einer wissenschaft-\nlichen Arbeit sollen präzise, nachvollziehbar und überprüfbar sein. Deshalb sind beim Schreibstil Kriterien wie Objektivität, Modalität, Folgerichtigkeit, Klarheit und Dichte \nzu berücksichtigen. \nDie Formulierung von Themen für Projektberichte oder Abschlussarbeiten an der \nAKAD University sollten mit dem gewünschten Betreuer abgestimmt werden. Die Ent-wicklung des Themas ist jedoch ein Bestandteil der Aufgabenstellung. Deshalb sollte \nein Thema für eine wissenschaftliche Arbeit einzigartig und präzise formuliert sein \nsowie eine konzeptionelle Bearbeitung ermöglichen.\nMit der Gliederung bzw. dem Inhaltsverzeichnis wird der „rote Faden“ der Arbeit ent-\nwickelt. Der Aufbau sollte dem deduktiven Prinzip folgen. Als Gliederungssystem ist \ndas dekadische System üblich.\nDie wissenschaftliche Arbeit selbst besteht aus einer Einleitung, einem Grundlagenteil, \neinem Hauptteil und einer Zusammenfassung. In der Einleitung geht es darum, den Leser in die Problemstellung einzuführen, das Zielsystem aufzubauen sowie die Bear-\nbeitungsmethode und den Aufbau der Arbeit zu erläutern.\nIm Grundlagenteil werden zentrale Begriffe diskutiert sowie die für die Bearbeitung der \nThemenstellung erforderlichen Methoden, Vorgehensweisen, Instrumente und Kon-zepte vorgestellt.\nIm Hauptteil geht es darum, die geforderte Konzeption oder Problemlösung systema-\ntisch zu erarbeiten.\nIm abschließenden Kapitel einer wissenschaftlichen Arbeit werden die wesentlichen \nErkenntnisse dokumentiert, die Vorgehensweise kritisch gewürdigt sowie ein Ausblick auf die zukünftigen Entwicklungen erarbeitet. Zudem können diejenigen Faktoren \nerläutert werden, von denen die Lösung abhängig ist.\nNicht zu vernachlässigen ist schließlich die wissenschaftliche Nacharbeit.

zu \nden Kontrollfragen\nåSQL301Antworten zu den Kontrollfragen\nK1__Seite 9\nDer Leser kann, wenn er möchte, auf die Quellen zurückgreifen und sich selbst mit \nihnen beschäftigen. – Generell gilt für das wissenschaftliche Arbeiten, nachvollziehbar \nund überprüfbar zu sein.\nK2__Seite 17\nBibliografien sind Verzeichnisse, die ursprünglich Literatur, heute aber auch andere \nMedien verzeichnen. Für die Recherche sind Bibliografien unschätzbar wichtige Hilfs-\nmittel, da über sie die Titelbestände aufgerufen werden können.\nBibliografien können das wissenschaftliche Arbeiten unterstützen, da sie mögliche \nQuellen verzeichnen. Diese Verzeichnisse sind für die Recherche sehr hilfreich, da in \nihnen z. B. über die Schlagwortfunktion gezielt zu einem Thema gesucht werden kann. \nFerner sind z. B. Fachbibliografien ein geeignetes Instrument zum wissenschaftlichen Arbeiten, da sie mögliche Quellen zu einem bestimmten Fach verzeichnen.\nK3__Seite 33\nMit „Reflect“ ist das kritische Reflektieren des Textes gemeint. Der Leser nimmt die \nAussagen nicht einfach hin, sondern hinterfragt sie auf ihren Wahrheitsgehalt. Dabei aktiviert er seine eigenen Erfahrungen, sein Wissen und seinen „gesunden Menschen-\nverstand“ und stellt die Frage: „Stimmt das (Gelesene) überhaupt?“\nK4__Seite 74\nEs gibt das alphanumerische und das numerische Inhaltsverzeichnis.\nK5__Seite 78\nDie Problemstellung zeigt auf, warum ein Thema nicht trivial ist und damit untersu-\nchungswürdig. Hier werden die entscheidenden Fragen gestellt, aus denen dann das \nZielsystem der Arbeit abgeleitet wird. Unter Problemstellung sollte nicht die Relevanz des Themas verstanden werden. Dabei handelt es sich um etwas anderes, die Bedeut-\nsamkeit eines Themas nämlich, aber nicht dessen Problematik.\nK6__Seite 34\nEs ist darauf zu achten, dass man das Gelesene irgendwie konserviert. Das kann auf unterschiedliche Weisen geschehen. So kann man die bedeutenden Stellen von einem \nText in ein eigenes Dokument übertragen.

zu\nden Kontrollfragen\nåSQL301K7__Seite 81\nEs sollten nur solche Begriffe definiert werden, die von zentraler Bedeutung für die \nArbeit sind und über die es kein einheitliches Begriffsverständnis in der Literatur gibt – die also Bedarf für eine Definition aufweisen.\nK8__Seite 23\nKatalogsuchmaschinen und Indexsuchmaschinen.\nK9__Seite 9\nRecherchieren bedeutet eigentlich Suchen. Gemeint ist die Suche nach wissenschaft-\nlichen Arbeiten innerhalb des Fachgebiets , auf dem man selbst ein Forschungsprojekt \ndurchführt. Es ist die gezielte Suche, deren Kurs von dem Thema vorgegeben wird, mit \nwelchem man sich beschäftigt. Von einem höheren Standpunkt aus betrachtet bedeutet \nRecherche den Versuch, eine Kontinuität des Wissens herzustellen, die über Raum- und Zeitgrenzen hinausgeht. Sie bedeutet den Versuch, die Wissenschaft fortschrittlich zu \nmachen.\nK10__ Seite 14\n„Monografien sind in sich geschlossene  Texte, die von einem oder mehreren Autoren  \nstammen und sich mit einem abgegrenzten  Themenfeld befassen.“\nK11__ Seite 82\nBei der Konzeptentwicklung lassen sich die Neuentwicklung und die Optimierung \nunterscheiden. Hierbei kann die Optimierung auch als selektive Neuentwicklung ver-standen werden.\nK12__ Seite 92\nGedankenführung, Gedankenwahl, Gedankendarstellung. Richtigkeit der Angaben, \nRichtigkeit der Sprache.\nK13__ Seite 58\nBeim Gebrauch von Tabellen und Abbildungen sollte folgendes beachtet werden: Sie \nsollten einheitlich sein, sie sind mit einem Rahmen zu versehen, einer fortlaufenden \nNummerierung und einem Titel, wobei diese in einem am Anfang der Arbeit stehenden gesonderten Verzeichnis aufzuführen sind. Es sollten keine überflüssigen Bestandteile \n(wie integrierte Überschriften) vorkommen, gleichwohl sollte das Element sich von \nselbst erklären und muss daher die relevanten Informationen (Spaltenüberschriften, Legenden und dergleichen) vorweisen. Gehen Tabellen und Abbildungen über mehrere \nSeiten, ist u.a. darauf zu achten, dass „(Fortsetzung)“ auf der nachfolgenden Seite steht, \nder Titel und ggf.

zu \nden Kontrollfragen\nåSQL301K14__ Seite 34\nHier sind vor allem drei Aspekte wichtig. Zum einen besteht dann die Möglichkeit, effi-\nzient und schnell in den Quellen zu navigieren und Such- und Sortierfunktionen zu nut-zen. Zum anderen können Informationen aus dem Internet und anderen Dateien direkt hineinkopiert, individuell markiert und weiterverarbeitet werden. Letzteres ist aber nur \nunter Angabe der Quelle im Rahmen eines direkten Zitates zulässig.\nDer dritte Vorteil einer elektronischen Quellenverwaltung ist die Möglichkeit, Hyper-\ntextverknüpfungen anzulegen und damit inhaltlich ähnlich gelagerte Quellen zusam-menzufassen.\nK15__ Seite 78\nDas Inhaltsverzeichnis sollte nicht nacherzählt werden. Vielmehr geht es in diesem letz-\nten Abschnitt der Einleitung darum, den Aufbau der Arbeit als in sich stimmig und damit schlüssig darzustellen.\nK16__ Seite 26\nWikipedia kann bei der Recherche durchaus verwendet werden. Da hier aber die Quel-\nlen keinerlei Kontrolle unterliegen, ist deren Korrektheit nicht verlässlich. Der Recher-chierende hat sich also an anderer Stelle ab zusichern und sollte sich auch nur auf die \nverlässliche Quelle, nicht aber auf Wikipedia, stützen.\nK17__ Seite 14\nGraue Literatur ist Literatur, die nicht oder noch nicht veröffentlicht wurde, jedenfalls nicht auf offiziellem Weg. Will man von ihr als Quelle Gebrauch machen, ist das nicht \nunproblematisch. Auch hier hat man sich an die Belegpflicht zu halten und dementspre-\nchende Maßnahmen zu ergreifen (z. B.

zu \nden Kontrollfragen\nåSQL301K28__ Seite 23\nViele Internetquellen und Graue Literatur entschlüpfen den Bibliografien. Über \nbestimmte Websuchmaschinen verschafft man sich auch auf diese Quellen Zugriff.\nK29__ Seite 50\nInformationen aus einem Vortrag eines Experten, der per Internet zugreifbar ist, können selbstverständlich in einer wissenschaftlichen Arbeit verwendet werden. Die Angabe \nder URL genügt jedoch nicht. Nach Möglichkeit sollten für einen Videoclip folgende \nAngaben im Literaturverzeichnis gemacht werden: Name des Autors oder des Regis-seurs oder Username: Titel des Clips, exakte URL (Zugriffsdatum). Verwendete \nSequenz in 00:00:00.\nK30__ Seite 28\nDer Präsenzbestand einer Bibliothek verweist auf die Medien, die nur vor Ort einzuse-hen sind. Das Gegenstück dazu bildet der sogenannten Leihbestand einer Bibliothek.\nK31__ Seite 30\nDas sequenzielle Lesen zeichnet sich dadurch aus, dass hier mit dem linearen Textfluss \ngelesen wird. Der Text wird damit vollständig gelesen. Sequenzielles Lesen im Rahmen von wissenschaftlichem Arbeiten bietet si ch beispielsweise bei Beschreibungen von \nMethoden an: Nur wenn man sie stringent von vorne nach hinten liest, kann man die \nbeschriebene Methode verstehen.\nK32__ Seite 40\nBei wörtlichen Zitaten dürfen die Gedanken eines Autors nicht verändert werden. \nDamit ist Aussage a.) völlig korrekt. Die Schriftart und Schriftgröße können in der \nRegel nicht übernommen werden, nur Hervorhebungen sind zu berücksichtigen. Aus-sage b.) ist damit falsch, ebenso c.) und d.), denn inhaltliche Veränderungen oder eine \nAnpassung der Formulierung ist nicht zu lässig.\nK33__ Seite 93\nDas Layout sollte zuletzt vorgenommen werden, nachdem das Lektorat beendet worden ist. Das Layout führt zu einem ordentlichen, leserfreundlichen Erscheinungsbild, das \nz. B. bestehende formale Vorgaben an die wissenschaftlichen Arbeiten erfüllt.\nK34__ Seite 50\nDiese Frage etwas tückisch. Die meisten Studenten würde einfach angeben: o.V.: Wert-schöpfungskette, in Gabler Wirtschaftslexikon (Hrsg.), exakte URL (Zugriffsdatum). \nDiese Angabe ist jedoch nicht ganz korrekt.

zu\nden Kontrollfragen\nåSQL301Die Beschaffung dieses Werks ist jedoch mit einem großen Aufwand verbunden. Es ist \nvor mehr wie 15 Jahren erschienen, so dass der Aufwand nicht mehr zumutbar ist.  Also \nwäre zu zitieren: Porter, 1985, zitiert nach: o.V.: Wertschöpfungskette, in Gabler Wirt-\nschaftslexikon (Hrsg.), exakte URL (Zugriffsdatum).\nK35__ Seite 26\nEine Volltextdatenbank gibt, wie der Name schon sagt, nicht nur ein Verzeichnis, son-dern gleich auch die vollständigen Texte wieder. Materialsuche und -beschaffung sind \nalso an ein und derselben Stelle möglich.\nK36__ Seite 9\nDie verwendeten Quellen sollten im Großen und Ganzen nicht älter sein wie ca. 15 Jahre. Einzelne ältere Werke können jedoch durchaus eingesetzt werden.\nK37__ Seite 14\nJa, die Lerneinheiten der AKAD University zu einzelnen Modulen eignen sich als Ein-\nstieg in die Recherche für eng abgegrenzte Themenbereiche, wie sie z. B. in Assign-ments bearbeitet werden. Für modul- und themenübergreifende Zusammenhänge sind in \nder Regel Fachbücher hilfreicher.\nK38__ Seite 54\nBei diesem Leitbild handelt es sich um „Graue Literatur“. Sie können für dieses Doku-ment entscheiden, ob Sie es als interne Unterlage oder als Monografie behandeln wol-\nlen. Wenn Sie das Leitbild als Monografie zitieren, dann sind die Antworten a) und b) \nkorrekt. Sowohl die Zitierweise mit „o. V.“ ist möglich wie auch diejenige mit der Bau-sparkasse als Herausgeber. Der Erscheinungsort Schwäbisch Hall kann allerdings nur \nvermutet werden.\nEntscheiden Sie sich, das Leitbild als „interne Unterlage“ zu zitieren, dann ist Antwort \nc) korrekt.\nK39__ Seite 33\nAntworten a) bis c) sind korrekt. Akademische Titel sind sicherlich hilfreich, um die \nQualität von Autoren einzuschätzen, doch werden sie üblicherweise in Publikationen \nnicht aufgeführt.\nK40__ Seite 40\nBei Kurzbelegen sind wichtige Angaben zum Autor und zur Quelle nur im Literaturver-\nzeichnis zu erkennen. Deshalb kann nur ein Kenner anhand des Kurzbelegs selbst die \nRelevanz einer Quelle beurteilen.	{"source": "book.pdf", "page": 102}	b47aee1a-845d-11ee-87d1-5686f88fa7cd	1760e6e2-0369-4df3-9750-fb114a4a4faf

begrif-\nfen wie „meine“ oder “ich“ erläutert.\nPFolgerichtigkeit: es werden Behauptungen aufgestellt, aber nicht folgerichtig argu-\nmentiert;\nPKlarheit: umgangssprachliche Formulierungen wie „keine großartige Verbesserung“ \noder „Zeitfresser“ sollten vermieden werden;\nPDichte: die Erläuterungen zu der „bunten Gestaltung der Arbeitsblätter“, den „zer-\npflückten Thematiken“ und „Grafiken und Skizzen“ hätten kompakter gestaltet wer-den können.\nK48__ Seite 54\nDurch die Ratifizierung der Empfehlung der ILO ist diese in Deutschland verbindlich \ngeworden.

Eine konzeptionelle Bearbeitung nur sehr eingeschränkt mög-\nlich, da vor allem die Gesetze beschrieben sowie die Auswirkungen erläutert werden. Die Formulierung ist präzise. Abkürzungen wurden nicht verwendet.\nAd. b): die Einzigartigkeit ist mit der Formulierung „… am Beispiel der Daimler Faci-\nlity Service GmbH“ sicherlich gewährleistet. Eine konzeptionelle Bearbeitung ist durch \ndie geforderte Selbstbewertung möglich. Der Titel ist wenig präzise, da nicht eindeutig zu erkennen ist, was in dieser Studie untersucht werden soll. Abkürzungen wie EFQM \noder DIN EN ISO erschweren das Verständnis.\nAd. c): der Bezug auf die Siemens AG gewährleistet die Einzigartigkeit der Unter-\nsuchung.

zu \nden Kontrollfragen\nåSQL301lemstellung für eine Abschlussarbeit viel zu breit. Die Analyse des gesamten Umfeldes \neines Weltkonzerns sowie die Entwicklung einer Personalstrategie für sämtliche Ge-\nschäftsbereiche sprengen den Rahmen einer Abschlussarbeit bei weitem. Die Formu-\nlierung ist präzise. Die Abkürzung „AG“ kann als allgemein bekannt vorausgesetzt werden.\nK51__ Seite 85\nMit der Formulierung „Ziel der Arbeit war es …“ wird das finale Ziel wieder aufgegrif-\nfen. Dieser Bezug zum Finalziel der Studie ist positiv zu würdigen. Der gesamte Grund-\nlagenteil wird dann jedoch in einem einzigen Satz zusammengefasst, der zudem wenig aussagefähig ist. Eine Dokumentation der Ergebnisse im Hauptteil der Studie fehlt. \nDamit fällt die Zusammenfassung viel zu kurz und zu oberflächlich aus.\nDie kritische Würdigung der eigenen Studie ist grundsätzlich gut gelungen. Der Ver-\nweis darauf, dass die Themenstellung einen medizinischen Charakter habe, die das Wis-sen des Autors überfordere ist jedoch nicht sinnvoll. Zum einen stellt sich dann die \nFrage, weshalb der Autor das Thema ausgewählt hat und zum zweiten ist das eigene \nbeschränkt Fachwissen kein objektives Argument für eine Beschränkung der Thematik. \nSchließlich übernimmt der Autor mit der Formulierung „Ziel vollumfänglich erreicht“ \ndie Aufgabe des Gutachters, ohne diese Behauptung differenziert zu begründen.

Transformation: Services  \n \nDie folgenden Lerninhalte beschäftigen  mit der Vorlesung „Digitale Transformation: \nServices“. Es wird im Folgenden erklärt , was Services/Dienstleistungen sind, und wie die \nDigitalisierung unsere Sicht auf Services verändert . \n \nHier ein Überblick, wie wir es festhalten wollen.  \n  \nService  ist der Oberbegriff. Jegliches Dienstleisten, ob digital oder nicht, ob Friseur, Beratung \noder Chatbot.  \n  \nDigitale Services  sind dann auch ein Oberbegriff, wenn der Service digital erf olgt.  \n  \nDie Dienstleistung  ist das, was die typische Dienstleistungsbranche erbringt. Eben der \nFriseur oder die Bank.  \n  \nDigitale Dienstleistungen  sind Dienstleistungen, die digitalisiert sind, also z. B. die digitale \nBeratung oder auch die digitale Finanz dienstleistung.  \n  \ne-Services  sind Digitale Services, die den eigentlichen Service unterstützen. Z. B. ein \nKonfigurationssystem, ein Chatbot, das Tracking und Tracing bis hin zu \nVermittlungsplattform.  \n  \nDigitale Produkte  sind der Oberbegriff für digitale Di enstleistungen und Medienprodukte.  \n  \nProdukte  sind Sachgüter und Dienstleistungen - alles,  was man auf Märkten verkauft.  \n  \nHybride Produkte  bestehen aus Sachgut und Dienstleistung. Meist bestehen sie aber aus \ndrei Aspekten: Sachgut, Dienstleistung und e -Service.  \n  \nUnd die Service Logik, geht davon aus, dass jedes Produkt  eigentlich ein Service ist. Dazu \nspäter . \n \nDrei Perspektiven der Dienstleistung  \n \nDienstleistungen können aus drei Perspektiven betrachtet werden. Die Dienstleistung ist ein \nPotenzial (die Leistungsfähigkeit des Unternehmens), ein Prozess und ein Produkt (nicht \nSachgut  „Dienstleistung als Potenzial“ bedeutet, dass Dienstleistungen die Fähigkeit \ndefinieren, einen Nutzen für den Kunden zu erstellen. Dienstleistungen können nicht ohne \nden Kunde n abschließend produziert werden. „Dienstleistung als Prozess“ bedeutet, dass \neine Dienstleistung ein Verrichtungsprozess an einem so genannten externen Faktor ist. \n„Dienstleistung als Produkt“ bedeutet, dass die Dienstleistung sich über ihr Ergebnis \ndefin iert. Dieses ist immateriell. Das Ergebnis der Dienstleistung ist ein Wert für den Kunden.  \n \nDeferierende Merkmale der Dienstleistung  \n  \nEs gibt zwei definierende Merkmale der Dienstleistung: Die Dienstleistung ist immateriell \nund ein externer Faktor ist notwendig.
